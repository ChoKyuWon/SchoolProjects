judges:1:2: [And] the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. 
judges:1:3: [And] Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; [and] I likewise will go with thee into thy lot.  So Simeon went with him. 
judges:1:4: [And] Judah went up; [and] the LORD delivered the Canaanites [and] the Perizzites into their hand: [and] they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 
judges:1:5: [And] they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: [and] they fought against him, [and] they slew the Canaanites [and] the Perizzites.  
judges:1:6: But Adoni-bezek fled; [and] they pursued after him, [and] caught him, [and] cut off his thumbs [and] his great toes. 
judges:1:7: [And] Adoni-bezek said, Threescore [and] ten kings, having their thumbs [and] their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so [God] hath requited me.  [And] they brought him to Jerusalem, [and] there he died.  
judges:1:8: Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, [and] had taken it, [and] smitten it with the edge of the sword, [and] set the city on fire.  
judges:1:9: [And] afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, [and] in the south, [and] in the valley. 
judges:1:10: [And] Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) [and] they slew Sheshai, [and] Ahiman, [and] Talmai. 
judges:1:11: [And] from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: [and] the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher: 
judges:1:12: [And] Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, [and] taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
judges:1:13: [And] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: [and] he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
judges:1:14: [And] it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: [and] she lighted from off her ass; [and] Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? 
judges:1:15: [And] she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.  [And] Caleb gave her the upper springs [and] the nether springs. 
judges:1:16: [And] the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; [and] they went [and] dwelt among the people. 
judges:1:17: [And] Judah went with Simeon his brother, [and] they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, [and] utterly destroyed it.  [And] the name of the city was called Hormah. 
judges:1:18: Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, [and] Askelon with the coast thereof, [and] Ekron with the coast thereof. 
judges:1:19: [And] the LORD was with Judah; [and] he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. 
judges:1:20: [And] they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: [and] he expelled thence the three sons of Anak. 
judges:1:21: [And] the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 
judges:1:22: [And] the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: [and] the LORD was with them. 
judges:1:23: [And] the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel.  (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) 
judges:1:24: [And] the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, [and] they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, [and] we will shew thee mercy. 
judges:1:25: [And] when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man [and] all his family. 
judges:1:26: [And] the man went into the land of the Hittites, [and] built a city, [and] called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. 
judges:1:27: Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean [and] her towns, nor Taanach [and] her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor [and] her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam [and] her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo [and] her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 
judges:1:28: [And] it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, [and] did not utterly drive them out.  
judges:1:30: Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, [and] became tributaries.  
judges:1:33: Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh [and] of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them. 
judges:1:34: [And] the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 
judges:1:35: But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, [and] in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries. 
judges:1:36: [And] the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, [and] upward. 
judges:2:1: [And] an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, [and] said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, [and] have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; [and] I said, I will never break my covenant with you. 
judges:2:2: [And] ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? 
judges:2:3: Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, [and] their gods shall be a snare unto you. 
judges:2:4: [And] it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, [and] wept. 
judges:2:5: [And] they called the name of that place Bochim: [and] they sacrificed there unto the LORD. 
judges:2:6: [And] when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
judges:2:7: [And] the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, [and] all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. 
judges:2:8: [And] Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred [and] ten years old. 
judges:2:9: [And] they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. 
judges:2:10: [And] also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: [and] there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 
judges:2:11: [And] the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, [and] served Baalim: 
judges:2:12: [And] they forsook the LORD [God] of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, [and] followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, [and] bowed themselves unto them, [and] provoked the LORD to anger. 
judges:2:13: [And] they forsook the LORD, [and] served Baal [and] Ashtaroth. 
judges:2:14: [And] the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, [and] he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, [and] he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.  
judges:2:15: Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, [and] as the LORD had sworn unto them: [and] they were greatly distressed. 
judges:2:17: [And] yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, [and] bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.  
judges:2:18: [And] when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, [and] delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them [and] vexed them. 
judges:2:19: [And] it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, [and] corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, [and] to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. 
judges:2:20: [And] the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; [and] he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, [and] have not hearkened unto my voice; 
judges:3:3: Namely, five lords of the Philistines, [and] all the Canaanites, [and] the Sidonians, [and] the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
judges:3:4: [And] they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
judges:3:5: [And] the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, [and] Amorites, [and] Perizzites, [and] Hivites, [and] Jebusites: 
judges:3:6: [And] they took their daughters to be their wives, [and] gave their daughters to their sons, [and] served their gods. 
judges:3:7: [And] the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, [and] forgat the LORD their [God,] [and] served Baalim [and] the groves. 
judges:3:8: Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, [and] he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: [and] the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years. 
judges:3:9: [And] when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 
judges:3:10: [And] the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, [and] he judged Israel, [and] went out to war: [and] the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; [and] his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim. 
judges:3:11: [And] the land had rest forty years.  [And] Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
judges:3:12: [And] the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: [and] the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
judges:3:13: [And] he gathered unto him the children of Ammon [and] Amalek, [and] went [and] smote Israel, [and] possessed the city of palm trees.  
judges:3:15: But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: [and] by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. 
judges:3:16: But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; [and] he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
judges:3:17: [And] he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: [and] Eglon was a very fat man. 
judges:3:18: [And] when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
judges:3:19: But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, [and] said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence.  [And] all that stood by him went out from him.  
judges:3:20: [And] Ehud came unto him; [and] he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone.  [And] Ehud said, I have a message from [God] unto thee.  [And] he arose out of his seat. 
judges:3:21: [And] Ehud put forth his left hand, [and] took the dagger from his right thigh, [and] thrust it into his belly:  
judges:3:22: [And] the haft also went in after the blade; [and] the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; [and] the dirt came out.  
judges:3:23: Then Ehud went forth through the porch, [and] shut the doors of the parlour upon him, [and] locked them. 
judges:3:24: When he was gone out, his servants came; [and] when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
judges:3:25: [And] they tarried till they were ashamed: [and,] behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, [and] opened them: [and,] behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. 
judges:3:26: [And] Ehud escaped while they tarried, [and] passed beyond the quarries, [and] escaped unto Seirath. 
judges:3:27: [And] it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, [and] the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, [and] he before them. 
judges:3:28: [And] he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.  [And] they went down after him, [and] took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, [and] suffered not a man to pass over. 
judges:3:29: [And] they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, [and] all men of valour; [and] there escaped not a man. 
judges:3:30: So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.  [And] the land had rest fourscore years. 
judges:3:31: [And] after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: [and] he also delivered Israel. 
judges:4:1: [And] the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. 
judges:4:2: [And] the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
judges:4:3: [And] the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; [and] twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. 
judges:4:4: [And] Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
judges:4:5: [And] she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah [and] Bethel in mount Ephraim: [and] the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
judges:4:6: [And] she sent [and] called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, [and] said unto him, Hath not the LORD [God] of Israel commanded, saying, Go [and] draw toward mount Tabor, [and] take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali [and] of the children of Zebulun? 
judges:4:7: [And] I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots [and] his multitude; [and] I will deliver him into thine hand. 
judges:4:8: [And] Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. 
judges:4:9: [And] she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  [And] Deborah arose, [and] went with Barak to Kedesh. 
judges:4:10: [And] Barak called Zebulun [and] Naphtali to Kedesh; [and] he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: [and] Deborah went up with him.  
judges:4:11: Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, [and] pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh. 
judges:4:12: [And] they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.  
judges:4:13: [And] Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, [and] all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.  
judges:4:14: [And] Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee?  So Barak went down from mount Tabor, [and] ten thousand men after him. 
judges:4:15: [And] the LORD discomfited Sisera, [and] all his chariots, [and] all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, [and] fled away on his feet. 
judges:4:16: But Barak pursued after the chariots, [and] after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: [and] all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; [and] there was not a man left. 
judges:4:17: Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor [and] the house of Heber the Kenite. 
judges:4:18: [And] Jael went out to meet Sisera, [and] said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.  [And] when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 
judges:4:19: [And] he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.  [And] she opened a bottle of milk, [and] gave him drink, [and] covered him. 
judges:4:20: Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, [and] it shall be, when any man doth come [and] enquire of thee, [and] say, Is there any man here?  that thou shalt say, No. 
judges:4:21: Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, [and] took an hammer in her hand, [and] went softly unto him, [and] smote the nail into his temples, [and] fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep [and] weary.  So he died. 
judges:4:22: [And,] behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, [and] said unto him, Come, [and] I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.  [And] when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, [and] the nail was in his temples. 
judges:4:23: So [God] subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
judges:4:24: [And] the hand of the children of Israel prospered, [and] prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. 
judges:5:1: Then sang Deborah [and] Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, 
judges:5:3: Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD [God] of Israel. 
judges:5:4: LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, [and] the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. 
judges:5:5: The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD [God] of Israel. 
judges:5:6: In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, [and] the travellers walked through byways. 
judges:5:10: Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, [and] walk by the way.  
judges:5:12: Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, [and] lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 
judges:5:14: Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, [and] out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. 
judges:5:15: [And] the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, [and] also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley.  For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. 
judges:5:17: Gilead abode beyond Jordan: [and] why did Dan remain in ships?  Asher continued on the sea shore, [and] abode in his breaches. 
judges:5:18: Zebulun [and] Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. 
judges:5:19: The kings came [and] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money. 
judges:5:25: He asked water, [and] she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. 
judges:5:26: She put her hand to the nail, [and] her right hand to the workmen's hammer; [and] with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced [and] stricken through his temples. 
judges:5:28: The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, [and] cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming?  why tarry the wheels of his chariots? 
judges:5:31: So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.  [And] the land had rest forty years.  
judges:6:1: [And] the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: [and] the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.  
judges:6:2: [And] the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: [and] because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, [and] caves, [and] strong holds.  
judges:6:3: [And] so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, [and] the Amalekites, [and] the children of the east, even they came up against them; 
judges:6:4: [And] they encamped against them, [and] destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, [and] left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. 
judges:6:5: For they came up with their cattle [and] their tents, [and] they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they [and] their camels were without number: [and] they entered into the land to destroy it. 
judges:6:6: [And] Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; [and] the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. 
judges:6:7: [And] it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, 
judges:6:8: That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, [and] brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 
judges:6:9: [And] I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, [and] out of the hand of all that oppressed you, [and] drave them out from before you, [and] gave you their land;  
judges:6:10: [And] I said unto you, I am the LORD your [God;] fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. 
judges:6:11: [And] there came an angel of the LORD, [and] sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: [and] his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.  
judges:6:12: [And] the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, [and] said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.  
judges:6:13: [And] Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us?  [and] where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?  but now the LORD hath forsaken us, [and] delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. 
judges:6:14: [And] the LORD looked upon him, [and] said, Go in this thy might, [and] thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? 
judges:6:15: [And] he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, [and] I am the least in my father's house. 
judges:6:16: [And] the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, [and] thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. 
judges:6:17: [And] he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me. 
judges:6:18: Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, [and] bring forth my present, [and] set it before thee.  [And] he said, I will tarry until thou come again. 
judges:6:19: [And] Gideon went in, [and] made ready a kid, [and] unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, [and] he put the broth in a pot, [and] brought it out unto him under the oak, [and] presented it. 
judges:6:20: [And] the angel of [God] said unto him, Take the flesh [and] the unleavened cakes, [and] lay them upon this rock, [and] pour out the broth.  [And] he did so. 
judges:6:21: Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, [and] touched the flesh [and] the unleavened cakes; [and] there rose up fire out of the rock, [and] consumed the flesh [and] the unleavened cakes.  Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. 
judges:6:22: [And] when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD!  for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. 
judges:6:23: [And] the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. 
judges:6:24: Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, [and] called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites. 
judges:6:25: [And] it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, [and] throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, [and] cut down the grove that is by it: 
judges:6:26: [And] build an altar unto the LORD thy [God] upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, [and] take the second bullock, [and] offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. 
judges:6:27: Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, [and] did as the LORD had said unto him: [and] so it was, because he feared his father's household, [and] the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. 
judges:6:28: [And] when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, [and] the grove was cut down that was by it, [and] the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. 
judges:6:29: [And] they said one to another, Who hath done this thing?  [And] when they enquired [and] asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. 
judges:6:30: Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, [and] because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. 
judges:6:31: [And] Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal?  will ye save him?  he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a [god,] let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. 
judges:6:33: Then all the Midianites [and] the Amalekites [and] the children of the east were gathered together, [and] went over, [and] pitched in the valley of Jezreel. 
judges:6:34: But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, [and] he blew a trumpet; [and] Abi-ezer was gathered after him.  
judges:6:35: [And] he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: [and] he sent messengers unto Asher, [and] unto Zebulun, [and] unto Naphtali; [and] they came up to meet them.  
judges:6:36: [And] Gideon said unto [God,] If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, 
judges:6:37: Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; [and] if the dew be on the fleece only, [and] it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. 
judges:6:38: [And] it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, [and] thrust the fleece together, [and] wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. 
judges:6:39: [And] Gideon said unto [God,] Let not thine anger be hot against me, [and] I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, [and] upon all the ground let there be dew. 
judges:6:40: [And] [God] did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, [and] there was dew on all the ground. 
judges:7:1: Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, [and] all the people that were with him, rose up early, [and] pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
judges:7:2: [And] the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. 
judges:7:3: Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful [and] afraid, let him return [and] depart early from mount Gilead.  [And] there returned of the people twenty [and] two thousand; [and] there remained ten thousand. 
judges:7:4: [And] the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, [and] I will try them for thee there: [and] it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; [and] of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. 
judges:7:5: So he brought down the people unto the water: [and] the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. 
judges:7:6: [And] the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 
judges:7:7: [And] the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, [and] deliver the Midianites into thine hand: [and] let all the other people go every man unto his place. 
judges:7:8: So the people took victuals in their hand, [and] their trumpets: [and] he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, [and] retained those three hundred men: [and] the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. 
judges:7:9: [And] it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. 
judges:7:11: [And] thou shalt hear what they say; [and] afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host.  Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host. 
judges:7:12: [And] the Midianites [and] the Amalekites [and] all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; [and] their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. 
judges:7:13: [And] when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, [and] said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, [and,] lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, [and] came unto a tent, [and] smote it that it fell, [and] overturned it, that the tent lay along. 
judges:7:14: [And] his fellow answered [and] said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath [God] delivered Midian, [and] all the host.  
judges:7:15: [And] it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, [and] the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, [and] returned into the host of Israel, [and] said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. 
judges:7:16: [And] he divided the three hundred men into three companies, [and] he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, [and] lamps within the pitchers.  
judges:7:17: [And] he said unto them, Look on me, [and] do likewise: [and,] behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.  
judges:7:18: When I blow with a trumpet, I [and] all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, [and] say, The sword of the LORD, [and] of Gideon. 
judges:7:19: So Gideon, [and] the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; [and] they had but newly set the watch: [and] they blew the trumpets, [and] brake the pitchers that were in their hands. 
judges:7:20: [And] the three companies blew the trumpets, [and] brake the pitchers, [and] held the lamps in their left hands, [and] the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: [and] they cried, The sword of the LORD, [and] of Gideon. 
judges:7:21: [And] they stood every man in his place round about the camp: [and] all the host ran, [and] cried, [and] fled. 
judges:7:22: [And] the three hundred blew the trumpets, [and] the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: [and] the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, [and] to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath. 
judges:7:23: [And] the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, [and] out of Asher, [and] out of all Manasseh, [and] pursued after the Midianites. 
judges:7:24: [And] Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, [and] take before them the waters unto Beth-barah [and] Jordan.  Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, [and] took the waters unto Beth-barah [and] Jordan. 
judges:7:25: [And] they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb [and] Zeeb; [and] they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, [and] Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, [and] pursued Midian, [and] brought the heads of Oreb [and] Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. 
judges:8:1: [And] the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?  [And] they did chide with him sharply. 
judges:8:2: [And] he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?  Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer? 
judges:8:3: [God] hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb [and] Zeeb: [and] what was I able to do in comparison of you?  Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. 
judges:8:4: [And] Gideon came to Jordan, [and] passed over, he, [and] the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. 
judges:8:5: [And] he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, [and] I am pursuing after Zebah [and] Zalmunna, kings of Midian. 
judges:8:6: [And] the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah [and] Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 
judges:8:7: [And] Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah [and] Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness [and] with briers.  
judges:8:8: [And] he went up thence to Penuel, [and] spake unto them likewise: [and] the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him. 
judges:8:9: [And] he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.  
judges:8:10: Now Zebah [and] Zalmunna were in Karkor, [and] their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred [and] twenty thousand men that drew sword.  
judges:8:11: [And] Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah [and] Jogbehah, [and] smote the host: for the host was secure. 
judges:8:12: [And] when Zebah [and] Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, [and] took the two kings of Midian, Zebah [and] Zalmunna, [and] discomfited all the host. 
judges:8:13: [And] Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up, 
judges:8:14: [And] caught a young man of the men of Succoth, [and] enquired of him: [and] he described unto him the princes of Succoth, [and] the elders thereof, even threescore [and] seventeen men. 
judges:8:15: [And] he came unto the men of Succoth, [and] said, Behold Zebah [and] Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah [and] Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? 
judges:8:16: [And] he took the elders of the city, [and] thorns of the wilderness [and] briers, [and] with them he taught the men of Succoth. 
judges:8:17: [And] he beat down the tower of Penuel, [and] slew the men of the city. 
judges:8:18: Then said he unto Zebah [and] Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor?  [And] they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. 
judges:8:19: [And] he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. 
judges:8:20: [And] he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, [and] slay them.  But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 
judges:8:21: Then Zebah [and] Zalmunna said, Rise thou, [and] fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength.  [And] Gideon arose, [and] slew Zebah [and] Zalmunna, [and] took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks. 
judges:8:22: Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, [and] thy son, [and] thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. 
judges:8:23: [And] Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. 
judges:8:24: [And] Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey.  (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
judges:8:25: [And] they answered, We will willingly give them.  [And] they spread a garment, [and] did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. 
judges:8:26: [And] the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand [and] seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, [and] collars, [and] purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, [and] beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. 
judges:8:27: [And] Gideon made an ephod thereof, [and] put it in his city, even in Ophrah: [and] all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, [and] to his house. 
judges:8:28: Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more.  [And] the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. 
judges:8:29: [And] Jerubbaal the son of Joash went [and] dwelt in his own house. 
judges:8:30: [And] Gideon had threescore [and] ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.  
judges:8:31: [And] his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. 
judges:8:32: [And] Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, [and] was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.  
judges:8:33: [And] it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, [and] went a whoring after Baalim, [and] made Baal-berith their [god.]  
judges:8:34: [And] the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their [God,] who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: 
judges:9:1: [And] Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, [and] communed with them, [and] with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying, 
judges:9:2: Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore [and] ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?  remember also that I am your bone [and] your flesh. 
judges:9:3: [And] his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: [and] their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother. 
judges:9:4: [And] they gave him threescore [and] ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain [and] light persons, which followed him. 
judges:9:5: [And] he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, [and] slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore [and] ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself. 
judges:9:6: [And] all the men of Shechem gathered together, [and] all the house of Millo, [and] went, [and] made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem. 
judges:9:7: [And] when they told it to Jotham, he went [and] stood in the top of mount Gerizim, [and] lifted up his voice, [and] cried, [and] said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that [God] may hearken unto you. 
judges:9:8: The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; [and] they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 
judges:9:9: But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour [God] [and] man, [and] go to be promoted over the trees? 
judges:9:10: [And] the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 
judges:9:11: But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, [and] my good fruit, [and] go to be promoted over the trees? 
judges:9:12: Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 
judges:9:13: [And] the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth [God] [and] man, [and] go to be promoted over the trees? 
judges:9:14: Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 
judges:9:15: [And] the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come [and] put your trust in my shadow: [and] if not, let fire come out of the bramble, [and] devour the cedars of Lebanon. 
judges:9:16: Now therefore, if ye have done truly [and] sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, [and] if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal [and] his house, [and] have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; 
judges:9:17: (For my father fought for you, [and] adventured his life far, [and] delivered you out of the hand of Midian:  
judges:9:18: [And] ye are risen up against my father's house this day, [and] have slain his sons, threescore [and] ten persons, upon one stone, [and] have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;) 
judges:9:19: If ye then have dealt truly [and] sincerely with Jerubbaal [and] with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, [and] let him also rejoice in you:  
judges:9:20: But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, [and] devour the men of Shechem, [and] the house of Millo; [and] let fire come out from the men of Shechem, [and] from the house of Millo, [and] devour Abimelech.  
judges:9:21: [And] Jotham ran away, [and] fled, [and] went to Beer, [and] dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. 
judges:9:23: Then [God] sent an evil spirit between Abimelech [and] the men of Shechem; [and] the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 
judges:9:24: That the cruelty done to the threescore [and] ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, [and] their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; [and] upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren. 
judges:9:25: [And] the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, [and] they robbed all that came along that way by them: [and] it was told Abimelech. 
judges:9:26: [And] Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, [and] went over to Shechem: [and] the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
judges:9:27: [And] they went out into the fields, [and] gathered their vineyards, [and] trode the grapes, [and] made merry, [and] went into the house of their [god,] [and] did eat [and] drink, [and] cursed Abimelech. 
judges:9:28: [And] Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, [and] who is Shechem, that we should serve him?  is not he the son of Jerubbaal?  [and] Zebul his officer?  serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him? 
judges:9:29: [And] would to [God] this people were under my hand!  then would I remove Abimelech.  [And] he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, [and] come out. 
judges:9:30: [And] when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
judges:9:31: [And] he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed [and] his brethren be come to Shechem; [and,] behold, they fortify the city against thee. 
judges:9:32: Now therefore up by night, thou [and] the people that is with thee, [and] lie in wait in the field: 
judges:9:33: [And] it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, [and] set upon the city: [and,] behold, when he [and] the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. 
judges:9:34: [And] Abimelech rose up, [and] all the people that were with him, by night, [and] they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
judges:9:35: [And] Gaal the son of Ebed went out, [and] stood in the entering of the gate of the city: [and] Abimelech rose up, [and] the people that were with him, from lying in wait. 
judges:9:36: [And] when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains.  [And] Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. 
judges:9:37: [And] Gaal spake again [and] said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, [and] another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. 
judges:9:38: Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?  is not this the people that thou hast despised?  go out, I pray now, [and] fight with them. 
judges:9:39: [And] Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, [and] fought with Abimelech. 
judges:9:40: [And] Abimelech chased him, [and] he fled before him, [and] many were overthrown [and] wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.  
judges:9:41: [And] Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: [and] Zebul thrust out Gaal [and] his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
judges:9:42: [And] it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; [and] they told Abimelech.  
judges:9:43: [And] he took the people, [and] divided them into three companies, [and] laid wait in the field, [and] looked, [and,] behold, the people were come forth out of the city; [and] he rose up against them, [and] smote them.  
judges:9:44: [And] Abimelech, [and] the company that was with him, rushed forward, [and] stood in the entering of the gate of the city: [and] the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, [and] slew them. 
judges:9:45: [And] Abimelech fought against the city all that day; [and] he took the city, [and] slew the people that was therein, [and] beat down the city, [and] sowed it with salt. 
judges:9:46: [And] when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the [god] Berith. 
judges:9:47: [And] it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
judges:9:48: [And] Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he [and] all the people that were with him; [and] Abimelech took an axe in his hand, [and] cut down a bough from the trees, [and] took it, [and] laid it on his shoulder, [and] said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, [and] do as I have done.  
judges:9:49: [And] all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, [and] followed Abimelech, [and] put them to the hold, [and] set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men [and] women. 
judges:9:50: Then went Abimelech to Thebez, [and] encamped against Thebez, [and] took it.  
judges:9:51: But there was a strong tower within the city, [and] thither fled all the men [and] women, [and] all they of the city, [and] shut it to them, [and] gat them up to the top of the tower.  
judges:9:52: [And] Abimelech came unto the tower, [and] fought against it, [and] went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
judges:9:53: [And] a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, [and] all to brake his skull. 
judges:9:54: Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, [and] said unto him, Draw thy sword, [and] slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him.  [And] his young man thrust him through, [and] he died. 
judges:9:55: [And] when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 
judges:9:56: Thus [God] rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
judges:9:57: [And] all the evil of the men of Shechem did [God] render upon their heads: [and] upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. 
judges:10:1: [And] after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; [and] he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. 
judges:10:2: [And] he judged Israel twenty [and] three years, [and] died, [and] was buried in Shamir. 
judges:10:3: [And] after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, [and] judged Israel twenty [and] two years. 
judges:10:4: [And] he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, [and] they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
judges:10:5: [And] Jair died, [and] was buried in Camon. 
judges:10:6: [And] the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, [and] served Baalim, [and] Ashtaroth, [and] the gods of Syria, [and] the gods of Zidon, [and] the gods of Moab, [and] the gods of the children of Ammon, [and] the gods of the Philistines, [and] forsook the LORD, [and] served not him. 
judges:10:7: [And] the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, [and] he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, [and] into the hands of the children of Ammon. 
judges:10:8: [And] that year they vexed [and] oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 
judges:10:9: Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, [and] against Benjamin, [and] against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed. 
judges:10:10: [And] the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our [God,] [and] also served Baalim. 
judges:10:11: [And] the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, [and] from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, [and] from the Philistines? 
judges:10:12: The Zidonians also, [and] the Amalekites, [and] the Maonites, did oppress you; [and] ye cried to me, [and] I delivered you out of their hand. 
judges:10:13: Yet ye have forsaken me, [and] served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.  
judges:10:14: Go [and] cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 
judges:10:15: [And] the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.  
judges:10:16: [And] they put away the strange gods from among them, [and] served the LORD: [and] his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.  
judges:10:17: Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, [and] encamped in Gilead.  [And] the children of Israel assembled themselves together, [and] encamped in Mizpeh. 
judges:10:18: [And] the people [and] princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon?  he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
judges:11:1: Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, [and] he was the son of an harlot: [and] Gilead begat Jephthah. 
judges:11:2: [And] Gilead's wife bare him sons; [and] his wife's sons grew up, [and] they thrust out Jephthah, [and] said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman. 
judges:11:3: Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, [and] dwelt in the land of Tob: [and] there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, [and] went out with him. 
judges:11:4: [And] it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
judges:11:5: [And] it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 
judges:11:6: [And] they said unto Jephthah, Come, [and] be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. 
judges:11:7: [And] Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, [and] expel me out of my father's house?  [and] why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? 
judges:11:8: [And] the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, [and] fight against the children of Ammon, [and] be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
judges:11:9: [And] Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, [and] the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head? 
judges:11:10: [And] the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words. 
judges:11:11: Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, [and] the people made him head [and] captain over them: [and] Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh. 
judges:11:12: [And] Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? 
judges:11:13: [And] the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, [and] unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably. 
judges:11:14: [And] Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: 
judges:11:15: [And] said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 
judges:11:16: But when Israel came up from Egypt, [and] walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, [and] came to Kadesh; 
judges:11:17: Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.  [And] in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: [and] Israel abode in Kadesh.  
judges:11:18: Then they went along through the wilderness, [and] compassed the land of Edom, [and] the land of Moab, [and] came by the east side of the land of Moab, [and] pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab. 
judges:11:19: [And] Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; [and] Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.  
judges:11:20: But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, [and] pitched in Jahaz, [and] fought against Israel.  
judges:11:21: [And] the LORD [God] of Israel delivered Sihon [and] all his people into the hand of Israel, [and] they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 
judges:11:22: [And] they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, [and] from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 
judges:11:23: So now the LORD [God] of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, [and] shouldest thou possess it? 
judges:11:24: Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy [god] giveth thee to possess?  So whomsoever the LORD our [God] shall drive out from before us, them will we possess. 
judges:11:25: [And] now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?  did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, 
judges:11:26: While Israel dwelt in Heshbon [and] her towns, [and] in Aroer [and] her towns, [and] in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years?  why therefore did ye not recover them within that time? 
judges:11:27: Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel [and] the children of Ammon. 
judges:11:29: Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, [and] he passed over Gilead, [and] Manasseh, [and] passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, [and] from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. 
judges:11:30: [And] Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, [and] said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 
judges:11:31: Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, [and] I will offer it up for a burnt offering. 
judges:11:32: So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; [and] the LORD delivered them into his hands. 
judges:11:33: [And] he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, [and] unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter.  Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. 
judges:11:34: [And] Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, [and,] behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels [and] with dances: [and] she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
judges:11:35: [And] it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, [and] said, Alas, my daughter!  thou hast brought me very low, [and] thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, [and] I cannot go back. 
judges:11:36: [And] she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. 
judges:11:37: [And] she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up [and] down upon the mountains, [and] bewail my virginity, I [and] my fellows. 
judges:11:38: [And] he said, Go.  [And] he sent her away for two months: [and] she went with her companions, [and] bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 
judges:11:39: [And] it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: [and] she knew no man.  [And] it was a custom in Israel, 
judges:12:1: [And] the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, [and] went northward, [and] said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, [and] didst not call us to go with thee?  we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 
judges:12:2: [And] Jephthah said unto them, I [and] my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; [and] when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 
judges:12:3: [And] when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, [and] passed over against the children of Ammon, [and] the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 
judges:12:4: Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, [and] fought with Ephraim: [and] the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites.  
judges:12:5: [And] the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: [and] it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?  If he said, Nay; 
judges:12:6: Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: [and] he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.  Then they took him, [and] slew him at the passages of Jordan: [and] there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty [and] two thousand.  
judges:12:7: [And] Jephthah judged Israel six years.  Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, [and] was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.  
judges:12:8: [And] after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
judges:12:9: [And] he had thirty sons, [and] thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, [and] took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.  [And] he judged Israel seven years. 
judges:12:10: Then died Ibzan, [and] was buried at Bethlehem. 
judges:12:11: [And] after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; [and] he judged Israel ten years. 
judges:12:12: [And] Elon the Zebulonite died, [and] was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. 
judges:12:13: [And] after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. 
judges:12:14: [And] he had forty sons [and] thirty nephews, that rode on threescore [and] ten ass colts: [and] he judged Israel eight years. 
judges:12:15: [And] Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, [and] was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites. 
judges:13:1: [And] the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; [and] the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 
judges:13:2: [And] there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; [and] his wife was barren, [and] bare not. 
judges:13:3: [And] the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, [and] said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, [and] bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, [and] bear a son. 
judges:13:4: Now therefore beware, I pray thee, [and] drink not wine nor strong drink, [and] eat not any unclean thing: 
judges:13:5: For, lo, thou shalt conceive, [and] bear a son; [and] no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto [God] from the womb: [and] he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 
judges:13:6: Then the woman came [and] told her husband, saying, A man of [God] came unto me, [and] his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of [God,] very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: 
judges:13:7: But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, [and] bear a son; [and] now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to [God] from the womb to the day of his death. 
judges:13:8: Then Manoah intreated the LORD, [and] said, O my Lord, let the man of [God] which thou didst send come again unto us, [and] teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. 
judges:13:9: [And] [God] hearkened to the voice of Manoah; [and] the angel of [God] came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
judges:13:10: [And] the woman made haste, [and] ran, [and] shewed her husband, [and] said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day. 
judges:13:11: [And] Manoah arose, [and] went after his wife, [and] came to the man, [and] said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman?  [And] he said, I am.  
judges:13:12: [And] Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass.  How shall we order the child, [and] how shall we do unto him? 
judges:13:13: [And] the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.  
judges:13:15: [And] Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. 
judges:13:16: [And] the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: [and] if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.  For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. 
judges:13:17: [And] Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? 
judges:13:18: [And] the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? 
judges:13:19: So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, [and] offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: [and] the angel did wondrously; [and] Manoah [and] his wife looked on. 
judges:13:20: For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar.  [And] Manoah [and] his wife looked on it, [and] fell on their faces to the ground. 
judges:13:21: But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah [and] to his wife.  Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. 
judges:13:22: [And] Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen [God.] 
judges:13:23: But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering [and] a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. 
judges:13:24: [And] the woman bare a son, [and] called his name Samson: [and] the child grew, [and] the LORD blessed him. 
judges:13:25: [And] the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah [and] Eshtaol. 
judges:14:1: [And] Samson went down to Timnath, [and] saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. 
judges:14:2: [And] he came up, [and] told his father [and] his mother, [and] said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 
judges:14:3: Then his father [and] his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?  [And] Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 
judges:14:4: But his father [and] his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
judges:14:5: Then went Samson down, [and] his father [and] his mother, to Timnath, [and] came to the vineyards of Timnath: [and,] behold, a young lion roared against him. 
judges:14:6: [And] the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, [and] he rent him as he would have rent a kid, [and] he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 
judges:14:7: [And] he went down, [and] talked with the woman; [and] she pleased Samson well. 
judges:14:8: [And] after a time he returned to take her, [and] he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: [and,] behold, there was a swarm of bees [and] honey in the carcase of the lion.  
judges:14:9: [And] he took thereof in his hands, [and] went on eating, [and] came to his father [and] mother, [and] he gave them, [and] they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. 
judges:14:10: So his father went down unto the woman: [and] Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.  
judges:14:11: [And] it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.  
judges:14:12: [And] Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, [and] find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets [and] thirty change of garments: 
judges:14:13: But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets [and] thirty change of garments.  [And] they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. 
judges:14:14: [And] he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, [and] out of the strong came forth sweetness.  [And] they could not in three days expound the riddle. 
judges:14:15: [And] it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee [and] thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have?  is it not so? 
judges:14:16: [And] Samson's wife wept before him, [and] said, Thou dost but hate me, [and] lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, [and] hast not told it me.  [And] he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, [and] shall I tell it thee? 
judges:14:17: [And] she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: [and] it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: [and] she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
judges:14:18: [And] the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?  [and] what is stronger than a lion?  [And] he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 
judges:14:19: [And] the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, [and] he went down to Ashkelon, [and] slew thirty men of them, [and] took their spoil, [and] gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.  [And] his anger was kindled, [and] he went up to his father's house. 
judges:15:1: But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; [and] he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber.  But her father would not suffer him to go in. 
judges:15:2: [And] her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she?  take her, I pray thee, instead of her. 
judges:15:3: [And] Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 
judges:15:4: [And] Samson went [and] caught three hundred foxes, [and] took firebrands, [and] turned tail to tail, [and] put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. 
judges:15:5: [And] when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, [and] burnt up both the shocks, [and] also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives. 
judges:15:6: Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this?  [And] they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, [and] given her to his companion.  [And] the Philistines came up, [and] burnt her [and] her father with fire. 
judges:15:7: [And] Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, [and] after that I will cease. 
judges:15:8: [And] he smote them hip [and] thigh with a great slaughter: [and] he went down [and] dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 
judges:15:9: Then the Philistines went up, [and] pitched in Judah, [and] spread themselves in Lehi. 
judges:15:10: [And] the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us?  [And] they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. 
judges:15:11: Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, [and] said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us?  what is this that thou hast done unto us?  [And] he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. 
judges:15:12: [And] they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.  [And] Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. 
judges:15:13: [And] they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, [and] deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.  [And] they bound him with two new cords, [and] brought him up from the rock. 
judges:15:14: [And] when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: [and] the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, [and] the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, [and] his bands loosed from off his hands.  
judges:15:15: [And] he found a new jawbone of an ass, [and] put forth his hand, [and] took it, [and] slew a thousand men therewith. 
judges:15:16: [And] Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.  
judges:15:17: [And] it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, [and] called that place Ramath-lehi.  
judges:15:18: [And] he was sore athirst, [and] called on the LORD, [and] said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: [and] now shall I die for thirst, [and] fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? 
judges:15:19: But [God] clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, [and] there came water thereout; [and] when he had drunk, his spirit came again, [and] he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. 
judges:15:20: [And] he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. 
judges:16:1: Then went Samson to Gaza, [and] saw there an harlot, [and] went in unto her. 
judges:16:2: [And] it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.  [And] they compassed him in, [and] laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, [and] were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. 
judges:16:3: [And] Samson lay till midnight, [and] arose at midnight, [and] took the doors of the gate of the city, [and] the two posts, [and] went away with them, bar [and] all, [and] put them upon his shoulders, [and] carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron. 
judges:16:4: [And] it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
judges:16:5: [And] the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, [and] said unto her, Entice him, [and] see wherein his great strength lieth, [and] by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: [and] we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. 
judges:16:6: [And] Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, [and] wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. 
judges:16:7: [And] Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, [and] be as another man. 
judges:16:8: Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, [and] she bound him with them. 
judges:16:9: Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.  [And] she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  [And] he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire.  So his strength was not known. 
judges:16:10: [And] Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, [and] told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
judges:16:11: [And] he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, [and] be as another man. 
judges:16:12: Delilah therefore took new ropes, [and] bound him therewith, [and] said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  [And] there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.  [And] he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 
judges:16:13: [And] Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, [and] told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.  [And] he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
judges:16:14: [And] she fastened it with the pin, [and] said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  [And] he awaked out of his sleep, [and] went away with the pin of the beam, [and] with the web. 
judges:16:15: [And] she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me?  thou hast mocked me these three times, [and] hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. 
judges:16:16: [And] it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, [and] urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;  
judges:16:17: That he told her all his heart, [and] said unto her.  There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto [God] from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, [and] I shall become weak, [and] be like any other man. 
judges:16:18: [And] when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent [and] called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.  Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, [and] brought money in their hand.  
judges:16:19: [And] she made him sleep upon her knees; [and] she called for a man, [and] she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; [and] she began to afflict him, [and] his strength went from him.  
judges:16:20: [And] she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  [And] he awoke out of his sleep, [and] said, I will go out as at other times before, [and] shake myself.  [And] he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. 
judges:16:21: But the Philistines took him, [and] put out his eyes, [and] brought him down to Gaza, [and] bound him with fetters of brass; [and] he did grind in the prison house. 
judges:16:23: Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their [god,] [and] to rejoice: for they said, Our [god] hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
judges:16:24: [And] when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our [god] hath delivered into our hands our enemy, [and] the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. 
judges:16:25: [And] it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.  [And] they called for Samson out of the prison house; [and] he made them sport: [and] they set him between the pillars. 
judges:16:26: [And] Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 
judges:16:27: Now the house was full of men [and] women; [and] all the lords of the Philistines were there; [and] there were upon the roof about three thousand men [and] women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 
judges:16:28: [And] Samson called unto the LORD, [and] said, O Lord [GOD,] remember me, I pray thee, [and] strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O [God,] that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 
judges:16:29: [And] Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, [and] on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, [and] of the other with his left. 
judges:16:30: [And] Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.  [And] he bowed himself with all his might; [and] the house fell upon the lords, [and] upon all the people that were therein.  So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
judges:16:31: Then his brethren [and] all the house of his father came down, [and] took him, [and] brought him up, [and] buried him between Zorah [and] Eshtaol in the burying place of Manoah his father.  [And] he judged Israel twenty years. 
judges:17:1: [And] there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
judges:17:2: [And] he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, [and] spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.  [And] his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son. 
judges:17:3: [And] when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image [and] a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. 
judges:17:4: Yet he restored the money unto his mother; [and] his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, [and] gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image [and] a molten image: [and] they were in the house of Micah. 
judges:17:5: [And] the man Micah had an house of gods, [and] made an ephod, [and] teraphim, [and] consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
judges:17:7: [And] there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, [and] he sojourned there.  
judges:17:8: [And] the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: [and] he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. 
judges:17:9: [And] Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou?  [And] he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, [and] I go to sojourn where I may find a place.  
judges:17:10: [And] Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, [and] be unto me a father [and] a priest, [and] I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, [and] a suit of apparel, [and] thy victuals.  So the Levite went in.  
judges:17:11: [And] the Levite was content to dwell with the man; [and] the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
judges:17:12: [And] Micah consecrated the Levite; [and] the young man became his priest, [and] was in the house of Micah. 
judges:18:1: In those days there was no king in Israel: [and] in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel. 
judges:18:2: [And] the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, [and] from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, [and] to search it; [and] they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
judges:18:3: When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: [and] they turned in thither, [and] said unto him, Who brought thee hither?  [and] what makest thou in this place?  [and] what hast thou here? 
judges:18:4: [And] he said unto them, Thus [and] thus dealeth Micah with me, [and] hath hired me, [and] I am his priest. 
judges:18:5: [And] they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of [God,] that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. 
judges:18:6: [And] the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go. 
judges:18:7: Then the five men departed, [and] came to Laish, [and] saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet [and] secure; [and] there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; [and] they were far from the Zidonians, [and] had no business with any man. 
judges:18:8: [And] they came unto their brethren to Zorah [and] Eshtaol: [and] their brethren said unto them, What say ye? 
judges:18:9: [And] they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, [and,] behold, it is very good: [and] are ye still?  be not slothful to go, [and] to enter to possess the land. 
judges:18:10: When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, [and] to a large land: for [God] hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. 
judges:18:11: [And] there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah [and] out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. 
judges:18:12: [And] they went up, [and] pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim. 
judges:18:13: [And] they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, [and] came unto the house of Micah. 
judges:18:14: Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, [and] said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, [and] teraphim, [and] a graven image, [and] a molten image?  now therefore consider what ye have to do.  
judges:18:15: [And] they turned thitherward, [and] came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, [and] saluted him. 
judges:18:16: [And] the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.  
judges:18:17: [And] the five men that went to spy out the land went up, [and] came in thither, [and] took the graven image, [and] the ephod, [and] the teraphim, [and] the molten image: [and] the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.  
judges:18:18: [And] these went into Micah's house, [and] fetched the carved image, the ephod, [and] the teraphim, [and] the molten image.  Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? 
judges:18:19: [And] they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, [and] go with us, [and] be to us a father [and] a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe [and] a family in Israel? 
judges:18:20: [And] the priest's heart was glad, [and] he took the ephod, [and] the teraphim, [and] the graven image, [and] went in the midst of the people. 
judges:18:21: So they turned [and] departed, [and] put the little ones [and] the cattle [and] the carriage before them. 
judges:18:22: [And] when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, [and] overtook the children of Dan. 
judges:18:23: [And] they cried unto the children of Dan.  [And] they turned their faces, [and] said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? 
judges:18:24: [And] he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, [and] the priest, [and] ye are gone away: [and] what have I more?  [and] what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee? 
judges:18:25: [And] the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, [and] thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 
judges:18:26: [And] the children of Dan went their way: [and] when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned [and] went back unto his house. 
judges:18:27: [And] they took the things which Micah had made, [and] the priest which he had, [and] came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet [and] secure: [and] they smote them with the edge of the sword, [and] burnt the city with fire. 
judges:18:28: [And] there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, [and] they had no business with any man; [and] it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob.  [And] they built a city, [and] dwelt therein. 
judges:18:29: [And] they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. 
judges:18:30: [And] the children of Dan set up the graven image: [and] Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he [and] his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
judges:18:31: [And] they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of [God] was in Shiloh. 
judges:19:1: [And] it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. 
judges:19:2: [And] his concubine played the whore against him, [and] went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, [and] was there four whole months. 
judges:19:3: [And] her husband arose, [and] went after her, to speak friendly unto her, [and] to bring her again, having his servant with him, [and] a couple of asses: [and] she brought him into her father's house: [and] when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
judges:19:4: [And] his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; [and] he abode with him three days: so they did eat [and] drink, [and] lodged there. 
judges:19:5: [And] it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: [and] the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, [and] afterward go your way.  
judges:19:6: [And] they sat down, [and] did eat [and] drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, [and] tarry all night, [and] let thine heart be merry. 
judges:19:7: [And] when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.  
judges:19:8: [And] he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: [and] the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee.  [And] they tarried until afternoon, [and] they did eat both of them.  
judges:19:9: [And] when the man rose up to depart, he, [and] his concubine, [and] his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; [and] to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. 
judges:19:10: But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up [and] departed, [and] came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; [and] there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him. 
judges:19:11: [And] when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; [and] the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, [and] let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, [and] lodge in it. 
judges:19:12: [And] his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 
judges:19:13: [And] he said unto his servant, Come, [and] let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
judges:19:14: [And] they passed on [and] went their way; [and] the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. 
judges:19:15: [And] they turned aside thither, to go in [and] to lodge in Gibeah: [and] when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging. 
judges:19:16: [And,] behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; [and] he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
judges:19:17: [And] when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: [and] the old man said, Whither goest thou?  [and] whence comest thou? 
judges:19:18: [And] he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: [and] I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; [and] there is no man that receiveth me to house. 
judges:19:19: Yet there is both straw [and] provender for our asses; [and] there is bread [and] wine also for me, [and] for thy handmaid, [and] for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing. 
judges:19:20: [And] the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street. 
judges:19:21: So he brought him into his house, [and] gave provender unto the asses: [and] they washed their feet, [and] did eat [and] drink. 
judges:19:22: Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, [and] beat at the door, [and] spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 
judges:19:23: [And] the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. 
judges:19:24: Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, [and] his concubine; them I will bring out now, [and] humble ye them, [and] do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. 
judges:19:25: But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, [and] brought her forth unto them; [and] they knew her, [and] abused her all the night until the morning: [and] when the day began to spring, they let her go. 
judges:19:26: Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, [and] fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. 
judges:19:27: [And] her lord rose up in the morning, [and] opened the doors of the house, [and] went out to go his way: [and,] behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, [and] her hands were upon the threshold. 
judges:19:28: [And] he said unto her, Up, [and] let us be going.  But none answered.  Then the man took her up upon an ass, [and] the man rose up, [and] gat him unto his place.  
judges:19:29: [And] when he was come into his house, he took a knife, [and] laid hold on his concubine, [and] divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, [and] sent her into all the coasts of Israel. 
judges:19:30: [And] it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, [and] speak your minds.  
judges:20:1: Then all the children of Israel went out, [and] the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh. 
judges:20:2: [And] the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of [God,] four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. 
judges:20:4: [And] the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered [and] said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I [and] my concubine, to lodge. 
judges:20:5: [And] the men of Gibeah rose against me, [and] beset the house round about upon me by night, [and] thought to have slain me: [and] my concubine have they forced, that she is dead. 
judges:20:6: [And] I took my concubine, [and] cut her in pieces, [and] sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness [and] folly in Israel. 
judges:20:7: Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice [and] counsel. 
judges:20:8: [And] all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house. 
judges:20:10: [And] we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, [and] an hundred of a thousand, [and] a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. 
judges:20:12: [And] the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you? 
judges:20:13: Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, [and] put away evil from Israel.  But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel: 
judges:20:15: [And] the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty [and] six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
judges:20:16: Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, [and] not miss. 
judges:20:17: [And] the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war. 
judges:20:18: [And] the children of Israel arose, [and] went up to the house of [God,] [and] asked counsel of [God,] [and] said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?  [And] the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.  
judges:20:19: [And] the children of Israel rose up in the morning, [and] encamped against Gibeah. 
judges:20:20: [And] the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; [and] the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.  
judges:20:21: [And] the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, [and] destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty [and] two thousand men.  
judges:20:22: [And] the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, [and] set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. 
judges:20:23: (And the children of Israel went up [and] wept before the LORD until even, [and] asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?  [And] the LORD said, Go up against him.) 
judges:20:24: [And] the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
judges:20:25: [And] Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, [and] destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 
judges:20:26: Then all the children of Israel, [and] all the people, went up, [and] came unto the house of [God,] [and] wept, [and] sat there before the LORD, [and] fasted that day until even, [and] offered burnt offerings [and] peace offerings before the LORD. 
judges:20:27: [And] the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of [God] was there in those days, 
judges:20:28: [And] Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?  [And] the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. 
judges:20:29: [And] Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. 
judges:20:30: [And] the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, [and] put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 
judges:20:31: [And] the children of Benjamin went out against the people, [and] were drawn away from the city; [and] they began to smite of the people, [and] kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of [God,] [and] the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel. 
judges:20:32: [And] the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first.  But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, [and] draw them from the city unto the highways. 
judges:20:33: [And] all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, [and] put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: [and] the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah. 
judges:20:34: [And] there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, [and] the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them. 
judges:20:35: [And] the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: [and] the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty [and] five thousand [and] an hundred men: all these drew the sword. 
judges:20:37: [And] the liers in wait hasted, [and] rushed upon Gibeah; [and] the liers in wait drew themselves along, [and] smote all the city with the edge of the sword. 
judges:20:38: Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel [and] the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. 
judges:20:39: [And] when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite [and] kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle. 
judges:20:40: But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, [and,] behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. 
judges:20:41: [And] when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.  
judges:20:42: Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; [and] them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. 
judges:20:43: Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them, [and] trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.  
judges:20:44: [And] there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.  
judges:20:45: [And] they turned [and] fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: [and] they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; [and] pursued hard after them unto Gidom, [and] slew two thousand men of them. 
judges:20:46: So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty [and] five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. 
judges:20:47: But six hundred men turned [and] fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, [and] abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 
judges:20:48: [And] the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, [and] smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, [and] all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to. 
judges:21:2: [And] the people came to the house of [God,] [and] abode there till even before [God,] [and] lifted up their voices, [and] wept sore; 
judges:21:3: [And] said, O LORD [God] of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel? 
judges:21:4: [And] it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, [and] built there an altar, [and] offered burnt offerings [and] peace offerings. 
judges:21:5: [And] the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?  For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death. 
judges:21:6: [And] the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, [and] said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 
judges:21:8: [And] they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD?  [And,] behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. 
judges:21:9: For the people were numbered, [and,] behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. 
judges:21:10: [And] the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, [and] commanded them, saying, Go [and] smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women [and] the children. 
judges:21:11: [And] this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, [and] every woman that hath lain by man. 
judges:21:12: [And] they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: [and] they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 
judges:21:13: [And] the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, [and] to call peaceably unto them. 
judges:21:14: [And] Benjamin came again at that time; [and] they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: [and] yet so they sufficed them not. 
judges:21:15: [And] the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  
judges:21:17: [And] they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.  
judges:21:19: Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, [and] on the south of Lebonah. 
judges:21:20: Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go [and] lie in wait in the vineyards; 
judges:21:21: [And] see, [and,] behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, [and] catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, [and] go to the land of Benjamin. 
judges:21:22: [And] it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty. 
judges:21:23: [And] the children of Benjamin did so, [and] took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: [and] they went [and] returned unto their inheritance, [and] repaired the cities, [and] dwelt in them. 
judges:21:24: [And] the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe [and] to his family, [and] they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. 
2kings:1:2: [And] Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, [and] was sick: [and] he sent messengers, [and] said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the [god] of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease. 
2kings:1:3: But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, [and] say unto them, Is it not because there is not a [God] in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the [god] of Ekron? 
2kings:1:4: Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.  [And] Elijah departed. 
2kings:1:5: [And] when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? 
2kings:1:6: [And] they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, [and] said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, [and] say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a [God] in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the [god] of Ekron?  therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 
2kings:1:7: [And] he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, [and] told you these words? 
2kings:1:8: [And] they answered him, He was an hairy man, [and] girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.  [And] he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite. 
2kings:1:9: Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.  [And] he went up to him: [and,] behold, he sat on the top of an hill.  [And] he spake unto him, Thou man of [God,] the king hath said, Come down. 
2kings:1:10: [And] Elijah answered [and] said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of [God,] then let fire come down from heaven, [and] consume thee [and] thy fifty.  [And] there came down fire from heaven, [and] consumed him [and] his fifty. 
2kings:1:11: Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.  [And] he answered [and] said unto him, O man of [God,] thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. 
2kings:1:12: [And] Elijah answered [and] said unto them, If I be a man of [God,] let fire come down from heaven, [and] consume thee [and] thy fifty.  [And] the fire of [God] came down from heaven, [and] consumed him [and] his fifty. 
2kings:1:13: [And] he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.  [And] the third captain of fifty went up, [and] came [and] fell on his knees before Elijah, [and] besought him, [and] said unto him, O man of [God,] I pray thee, let my life, [and] the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. 
2kings:1:14: Behold, there came fire down from heaven, [and] burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. 
2kings:1:15: [And] the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him.  [And] he arose, [and] went down with him unto the king.  
2kings:1:16: [And] he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the [god] of Ekron, is it not because there is no [God] in Israel to enquire of his word?  therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 
2kings:1:17: So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.  [And] Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.  
2kings:2:1: [And] it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 
2kings:2:2: [And] Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel.  [And] Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, [and] as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they went down to Bethel. 
2kings:2:3: [And] the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, [and] said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?  [And] he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. 
2kings:2:4: [And] Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.  [And] he said, As the LORD liveth, [and] as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they came to Jericho. 
2kings:2:5: [And] the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, [and] said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?  [And] he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. 
2kings:2:6: [And] Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan.  [And] he said, As the LORD liveth, [and] as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  [And] they two went on. 
2kings:2:7: [And] fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, [and] stood to view afar off: [and] they two stood by Jordan. 
2kings:2:8: [And] Elijah took his mantle, [and] wrapped it together, [and] smote the waters, [and] they were divided hither [and] thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. 
2kings:2:9: [And] it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.  [And] Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. 
2kings:2:10: [And] he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. 
2kings:2:11: [And] it came to pass, as they still went on, [and] talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, [and] horses of fire, [and] parted them both asunder; [and] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
2kings:2:12: [And] Elisha saw it, [and] he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, [and] the horsemen thereof.  [And] he saw him no more: [and] he took hold of his own clothes, [and] rent them in two pieces. 
2kings:2:13: He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, [and] went back, [and] stood by the bank of Jordan; 
2kings:2:14: [And] he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, [and] smote the waters, [and] said, Where is the LORD [God] of Elijah?  [and] when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither [and] thither: [and] Elisha went over. 
2kings:2:15: [And] when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.  [And] they came to meet him, [and] bowed themselves to the ground before him. 
2kings:2:16: [And] they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, [and] seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, [and] cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.  [And] he said, Ye shall not send. 
2kings:2:17: [And] when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.  They sent therefore fifty men; [and] they sought three days, but found him not. 
2kings:2:18: [And] when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? 
2kings:2:19: [And] the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, [and] the ground barren. 
2kings:2:20: [And] he said, Bring me a new cruse, [and] put salt therein.  [And] they brought it to him. 
2kings:2:21: [And] he went forth unto the spring of the waters, [and] cast the salt in there, [and] said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.  
2kings:2:23: [And] he went up from thence unto Bethel: [and] as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, [and] mocked him, [and] said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  
2kings:2:24: [And] he turned back, [and] looked on them, [and] cursed them in the name of the LORD.  [And] there came forth two she bears out of the wood, [and] tare forty [and] two children of them.  
2kings:2:25: [And] he went from thence to mount Carmel, [and] from thence he returned to Samaria. 
2kings:3:1: Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, [and] reigned twelve years. 
2kings:3:2: [And] he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, [and] like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. 
2kings:3:4: [And] Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, [and] rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, [and] an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 
2kings:3:6: [And] king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, [and] numbered all Israel. 
2kings:3:7: [And] he went [and] sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?  [And] he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses. 
2kings:3:8: [And] he said, Which way shall we go up?  [And] he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. 
2kings:3:9: So the king of Israel went, [and] the king of Judah, [and] the king of Edom: [and] they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: [and] there was no water for the host, [and] for the cattle that followed them. 
2kings:3:10: [And] the king of Israel said, Alas!  that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! 
2kings:3:11: But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him?  [And] one of the king of Israel's servants answered [and] said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. 
2kings:3:12: [And] Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him.  So the king of Israel [and] Jehoshaphat [and] the king of Edom went down to him. 
2kings:3:13: [And] Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, [and] to the prophets of thy mother.  [And] the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. 
2kings:3:14: [And] Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. 
2kings:3:15: But now bring me a minstrel.  [And] it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. 
2kings:3:16: [And] he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 
2kings:3:17: For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, [and] your cattle, [and] your beasts. 
2kings:3:18: [And] this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.  
2kings:3:19: [And] ye shall smite every fenced city, [and] every choice city, [and] shall fell every good tree, [and] stop all wells of water, [and] mar every good piece of land with stones. 
2kings:3:20: [And] it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, [and] the country was filled with water.  
2kings:3:21: [And] when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, [and] upward, [and] stood in the border.  
2kings:3:22: [And] they rose up early in the morning, [and] the sun shone upon the water, [and] the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood: 
2kings:3:23: [And] they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, [and] they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. 
2kings:3:24: [And] when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up [and] smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. 
2kings:3:25: [And] they beat down the cities, [and] on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, [and] filled it; [and] they stopped all the wells of water, [and] felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, [and] smote it. 
2kings:3:26: [And] when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not. 
2kings:3:27: Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, [and] offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall.  [And] there was great indignation against Israel: [and] they departed from him, [and] returned to their own land. 
2kings:4:1: Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; [and] thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: [and] the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 
2kings:4:2: [And] Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee?  tell me, what hast thou in the house?  [And] she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
2kings:4:4: [And] when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee [and] upon thy sons, [and] shalt pour out into all those vessels, [and] thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
2kings:4:5: So she went from him, [and] shut the door upon her [and] upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; [and] she poured out. 
2kings:4:6: [And] it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel.  [And] he said unto her, There is not a vessel more.  [And] the oil stayed. 
2kings:4:7: Then she came [and] told the man of [God.]  [And] he said, Go, sell the oil, [and] pay thy debt, [and] live thou [and] thy children of the rest. 
2kings:4:8: [And] it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; [and] she constrained him to eat bread.  [And] so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 
2kings:4:9: [And] she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of [God,] which passeth by us continually. 
2kings:4:10: Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; [and] let us set for him there a bed, [and] a table, [and] a stool, [and] a candlestick: [and] it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. 
2kings:4:11: [And] it fell on a day, that he came thither, [and] he turned into the chamber, [and] lay there. 
2kings:4:12: [And] he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite.  [And] when he had called her, she stood before him. 
2kings:4:13: [And] he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?  wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?  [And] she answered, I dwell among mine own people.  
2kings:4:14: [And] he said, What then is to be done for her?  [And] Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, [and] her husband is old. 
2kings:4:15: [And] he said, Call her.  [And] when he had called her, she stood in the door.  
2kings:4:16: [And] he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.  [And] she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of [God,] do not lie unto thine handmaid.  
2kings:4:17: [And] the woman conceived, [and] bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. 
2kings:4:18: [And] when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
2kings:4:19: [And] he said unto his father, My head, my head.  [And] he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 
2kings:4:20: [And] when he had taken him, [and] brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, [and] then died. 
2kings:4:21: [And] she went up, [and] laid him on the bed of the man of [God,] [and] shut the door upon him, [and] went out. 
2kings:4:22: [And] she called unto her husband, [and] said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, [and] one of the asses, that I may run to the man of [God,] [and] come again. 
2kings:4:23: [And] he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?  it is neither new moon, nor sabbath.  [And] she said, It shall be well. 
2kings:4:24: Then she saddled an ass, [and] said to her servant, Drive, [and] go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee. 
2kings:4:25: So she went [and] came unto the man of [God] to mount Carmel.  [And] it came to pass, when the man of [God] saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 
2kings:4:26: Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, [and] say unto her, Is it well with thee?  is it well with thy husband?  is it well with the child?  [And] she answered, It is well. 
2kings:4:27: [And] when she came to the man of [God] to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away.  [And] the man of [God] said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: [and] the LORD hath hid it from me, [and] hath not told me. 
2kings:4:29: Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, [and] take my staff in thine hand, [and] go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; [and] if any salute thee, answer him not again: [and] lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
2kings:4:30: [And] the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, [and] as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  [And] he arose, [and] followed her. 
2kings:4:31: [And] Gehazi passed on before them, [and] laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.  Wherefore he went again to meet him, [and] told him, saying, The child is not awaked. 
2kings:4:32: [And] when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, [and] laid upon his bed. 
2kings:4:33: He went in therefore, [and] shut the door upon them twain, [and] prayed unto the LORD. 
2kings:4:34: [And] he went up, [and] lay upon the child, [and] put his mouth upon his mouth, [and] his eyes upon his eyes, [and] his hands upon his hands: [and] he stretched himself upon the child; [and] the flesh of the child waxed warm. 
2kings:4:35: Then he returned, [and] walked in the house to [and] fro; [and] went up, [and] stretched himself upon him: [and] the child sneezed seven times, [and] the child opened his eyes. 
2kings:4:36: [And] he called Gehazi, [and] said, Call this Shunammite.  So he called her.  [And] when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.  
2kings:4:37: Then she went in, [and] fell at his feet, [and] bowed herself to the ground, [and] took up her son, [and] went out. 
2kings:4:38: [And] Elisha came again to Gilgal: [and] there was a dearth in the land; [and] the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: [and] he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, [and] seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 
2kings:4:39: [And] one went out into the field to gather herbs, [and] found a wild vine, [and] gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, [and] came [and] shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. 
2kings:4:40: So they poured out for the men to eat.  [And] it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, [and] said, O thou man of [God,] there is death in the pot.  [And] they could not eat thereof. 
2kings:4:41: But he said, Then bring meal.  [And] he cast it into the pot; [and] he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat.  [And] there was no harm in the pot. 
2kings:4:42: [And] there came a man from Baal-shalisha, [and] brought the man of [God] bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, [and] full ears of corn in the husk thereof.  [And] he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.  
2kings:4:43: [And] his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, [and] shall leave thereof. 
2kings:4:44: So he set it before them, [and] they did eat, [and] left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.  
2kings:5:1: Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, [and] honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper. 
2kings:5:2: [And] the Syrians had gone out by companies, [and] had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; [and] she waited on Naaman's wife. 
2kings:5:3: [And] she said unto her mistress, Would [God] my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria!  for he would recover him of his leprosy. 
2kings:5:4: [And] one went in, [and] told his lord, saying, Thus [and] thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. 
2kings:5:5: [And] the king of Syria said, Go to, go, [and] I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.  [And] he departed, [and] took with him ten talents of silver, [and] six thousand pieces of gold, [and] ten changes of raiment. 
2kings:5:6: [And] he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. 
2kings:5:7: [And] it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, [and] said, Am I [God,] to kill [and] to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?  wherefore consider, I pray you, [and] see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. 
2kings:5:8: [And] it was so, when Elisha the man of [God] had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?  let him come now to me, [and] he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 
2kings:5:9: So Naaman came with his horses [and] with his chariot, [and] stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 
2kings:5:10: [And] Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go [and] wash in the Jordan seven times, [and] thy flesh shall come again to thee, [and] thou shalt be clean. 
2kings:5:11: But Naaman was wroth, [and] went away, [and] said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, [and] stand, [and] call on the name of the LORD his [God,] [and] strike his hand over the place, [and] recover the leper. 
2kings:5:12: Are not Abana [and] Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  may I not wash in them, [and] be clean?  So he turned [and] went away in a rage. 
2kings:5:13: [And] his servants came near, [and] spake unto him, [and] said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?  how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, [and] be clean? 
2kings:5:14: Then went he down, [and] dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: [and] his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, [and] he was clean. 
2kings:5:15: [And] he returned to the man of [God,] he [and] all his company, [and] came, [and] stood before him: [and] he said, Behold, now I know that there is no [God] in all earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. 
2kings:5:16: But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.  [And] he urged him to take it; but he refused. 
2kings:5:17: [And] Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?  for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. 
2kings:5:18: In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, [and] he leaneth on my hand, [and] I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. 
2kings:5:19: [And] he said unto him, Go in peace.  So he departed from him a little way. 
2kings:5:20: But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of [God,] said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, [and] take somewhat of him.  
2kings:5:21: So Gehazi followed after Naaman.  [And] when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, [and] said, Is all well? 
2kings:5:22: [And] he said, All is well.  My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, [and] two changes of garments.  
2kings:5:23: [And] Naaman said, Be content, take two talents.  [And] he urged him, [and] bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, [and] laid them upon two of his servants; [and] they bare them before him.  
2kings:5:24: [And] when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, [and] bestowed them in the house: [and] he let the men go, [and] they departed. 
2kings:5:25: But he went in, [and] stood before his master.  [And] Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi?  [And] he said, Thy servant went no whither. 
2kings:5:26: [And] he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?  Is it a time to receive money, [and] to receive garments, [and] oliveyards, [and] vineyards, [and] sheep, [and] oxen, [and] menservants, [and] maidservants? 
2kings:5:27: The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, [and] unto thy seed for ever.  [And] he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. 
2kings:6:1: [And] the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 
2kings:6:2: Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, [and] take thence every man a beam, [and] let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.  [And] he answered, Go ye. 
2kings:6:3: [And] one said, Be content, I pray thee, [and] go with thy servants.  [And] he answered, I will go. 
2kings:6:4: So he went with them.  [And] when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. 
2kings:6:5: But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: [and] he cried, [and] said, Alas, master!  for it was borrowed. 
2kings:6:6: [And] the man of [God] said, Where fell it?  [And] he shewed him the place.  [And] he cut down a stick, [and] cast it in thither; [and] the iron did swim. 
2kings:6:7: Therefore said he, Take it up to thee.  [And] he put out his hand, [and] took it. 
2kings:6:8: Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, [and] took counsel with his servants, saying, In such [and] such a place shall be my camp. 
2kings:6:9: [And] the man of [God] sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. 
2kings:6:10: [And] the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of [God] told him [and] warned him of, [and] saved himself there, not once nor twice. 
2kings:6:11: Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; [and] he called his servants, [and] said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel? 
2kings:6:12: [And] one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. 
2kings:6:13: [And] he said, Go [and] spy where he is, that I may send [and] fetch him.  [And] it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
2kings:6:14: Therefore sent he thither horses, [and] chariots, [and] a great host: [and] they came by night, [and] compassed the city about. 
2kings:6:15: [And] when the servant of the man of [God] was risen early, [and] gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses [and] chariots.  [And] his servant said unto him, Alas, my master!  how shall we do?  
2kings:6:16: [And] he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. 
2kings:6:17: [And] Elisha prayed, [and] said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.  [And] the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; [and] he saw: [and,] behold, the mountain was full of horses [and] chariots of fire round about Elisha.  
2kings:6:18: [And] when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, [and] said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.  [And] he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.  
2kings:6:19: [And] Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, [and] I will bring you to the man whom ye seek.  But he led them to Samaria. 
2kings:6:20: [And] it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.  [And] the LORD opened their eyes, [and] they saw; [and,] behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. 
2kings:6:21: [And] the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them?  shall I smite them? 
2kings:6:22: [And] he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword [and] with thy bow?  set bread [and] water before them, that they may eat [and] drink, [and] go to their master. 
2kings:6:23: [And] he prepared great provision for them: [and] when they had eaten [and] drunk, he sent them away, [and] they went to their master.  So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 
2kings:6:24: [And] it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, [and] went up, [and] besieged Samaria. 
2kings:6:25: [And] there was a great famine in Samaria: [and,] behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, [and] the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. 
2kings:6:26: [And] as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
2kings:6:27: [And] he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? 
2kings:6:28: [And] the king said unto her, What aileth thee?  [And] she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, [and] we will eat my son to morrow. 
2kings:6:29: So we boiled my son, [and] did eat him: [and] I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: [and] she hath hid her son. 
2kings:6:30: [And] it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; [and] he passed by upon the wall, [and] the people looked, [and,] behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. 
2kings:6:31: Then he said, [God] do so [and] more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 
2kings:6:32: But Elisha sat in his house, [and] the elders sat with him; [and] the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?  look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, [and] hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? 
2kings:6:33: [And] while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: [and] he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer? 
2kings:7:1: Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, [and] two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. 
2kings:7:2: Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of [God,] [and] said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  [And] he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 
2kings:7:3: [And] there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: [and] they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  
2kings:7:4: If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, [and] we shall die there: [and] if we sit still here, we die also.  Now therefore come, [and] let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; [and] if they kill us, we shall but die. 
2kings:7:5: [And] they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: [and] when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.  
2kings:7:6: For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, [and] a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: [and] they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, [and] the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.  
2kings:7:7: Wherefore they arose [and] fled in the twilight, [and] left their tents, [and] their horses, [and] their asses, even the camp as it was, [and] fled for their life. 
2kings:7:8: [And] when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, [and] did eat [and] drink, [and] carried thence silver, [and] gold, [and] raiment, [and] went [and] hid it; [and] came again, [and] entered into another tent, [and] carried thence also, [and] went [and] hid it. 
2kings:7:9: Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, [and] we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go [and] tell the king's household. 
2kings:7:10: So they came [and] called unto the porter of the city: [and] they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, [and,] behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, [and] asses tied, [and] the tents as they were. 
2kings:7:11: [And] he called the porters; [and] they told it to the king's house within. 
2kings:7:12: [And] the king arose in the night, [and] said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us.  They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, [and] get into the city. 
2kings:7:13: [And] one of his servants answered [and] said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) [and] let us send [and] see. 
2kings:7:14: They took therefore two chariot horses; [and] the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go [and] see. 
2kings:7:15: [And] they went after them unto Jordan: [and,] lo, all the way was full of garments [and] vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.  [And] the messengers returned, [and] told the king. 
2kings:7:16: [And] the people went out, [and] spoiled the tents of the Syrians.  So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, [and] two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. 
2kings:7:17: [And] the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: [and] the people trode upon him in the gate, [and] he died, as the man of [God] had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 
2kings:7:18: [And] it came to pass as the man of [God] had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, [and] a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: 
2kings:7:19: [And] that lord answered the man of [God,] [and] said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?  [And] he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 
2kings:7:20: [And] so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, [and] he died. 
2kings:8:1: Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, [and] go thou [and] thine household, [and] sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; [and] it shall also come upon the land seven years. 
2kings:8:2: [And] the woman arose, [and] did after the saying of the man of God: [and] she went with her household, [and] sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
2kings:8:3: [And] it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: [and] she went forth to cry unto the king for her house [and] for her land. 
2kings:8:4: [And] the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of [God,] saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. 
2kings:8:5: [And] it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house [and] for her land.  [And] Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, [and] this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.  
2kings:8:6: [And] when the king asked the woman, she told him.  So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, [and] all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. 
2kings:8:7: [And] Elisha came to Damascus; [and] Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; [and] it was told him, saying, The man of [God] is come hither.  
2kings:8:8: [And] the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, [and] go, meet the man of [God,] [and] enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?  
2kings:8:9: So Hazael went to meet him, [and] took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, [and] came [and] stood before him, [and] said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
2kings:8:10: [And] Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. 
2kings:8:11: [And] he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: [and] the man of [God] wept. 
2kings:8:12: [And] Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?  [And] he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, [and] their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, [and] wilt dash their children, [and] rip up their women with child. 
2kings:8:13: [And] Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?  [And] Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria. 
2kings:8:14: So he departed from Elisha, [and] came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?  [And] he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. 
2kings:8:15: [And] it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, [and] dipped it in water, [and] spread it on his face, so that he died: [and] Hazael reigned in his stead. 
2kings:8:16: [And] in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 
2kings:8:17: Thirty [and] two years old was he when he began to reign; [and] he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2kings:8:18: [And] he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: [and] he did evil in the sight of the LORD. 
2kings:8:19: Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, [and] to his children. 
2kings:8:20: In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, [and] made a king over themselves. 
2kings:8:21: So Joram went over to Zair, [and] all the chariots with him: [and] he rose by night, [and] smote the Edomites which compassed him about, [and] the captains of the chariots: [and] the people fled into their tents. 
2kings:8:23: [And] the rest of the acts of Joram, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:8:24: [And] Joram slept with his fathers, [and] was buried with his fathers in the city of David: [and] Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:8:26: Two [and] twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; [and] he reigned one year in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2kings:8:27: [And] he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, [and] did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab. 
2kings:8:28: [And] he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; [and] the Syrians wounded Joram.  
2kings:8:29: [And] king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.  [And] Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. 
2kings:9:1: [And] Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, [and] said unto him, Gird up thy loins, [and] take this box of oil in thine hand, [and] go to Ramoth-gilead:  
2kings:9:2: [And] when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, [and] go in, [and] make him arise up from among his brethren, [and] carry him to an inner chamber; 
2kings:9:3: Then take the box of oil, [and] pour it on his head, [and] say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.  Then open the door, [and] flee, [and] tarry not. 
2kings:9:5: [And] when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; [and] he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain.  [And] Jehu said, Unto which of all us?  [And] he said, To thee, O captain. 
2kings:9:6: [And] he arose, [and] went into the house; [and] he poured the oil on his head, [and] said unto him, Thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. 
2kings:9:7: [And] thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, [and] the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 
2kings:9:8: For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: [and] I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, [and] him that is shut up [and] left in Israel: 
2kings:9:9: [And] I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, [and] like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: 
2kings:9:10: [And] the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, [and] there shall be none to bury her.  [And] he opened the door, [and] fled. 
2kings:9:11: Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: [and] one said unto him, Is all well?  wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?  [And] he said unto them, Ye know the man, [and] his communication. 
2kings:9:12: [And] they said, It is false; tell us now.  [And] he said, Thus [and] thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. 
2kings:9:13: Then they hasted, [and] took every man his garment, [and] put it under him on the top of the stairs, [and] blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. 
2kings:9:14: So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.  (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he [and] all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. 
2kings:9:15: But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) [And] Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. 
2kings:9:16: So Jehu rode in a chariot, [and] went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.  [And] Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 
2kings:9:17: [And] there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, [and] he spied the company of Jehu as he came, [and] said, I see a company.  [And] Joram said, Take an horseman, [and] send to meet them, [and] let him say, Is it peace?  
2kings:9:18: So there went one on horseback to meet him, [and] said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?  [And] Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace?  turn thee behind me.  [And] the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 
2kings:9:19: Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, [and] said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?  [And] Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace?  turn thee behind me.  
2kings:9:20: [And] the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, [and] cometh not again: [and] the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.  
2kings:9:21: [And] Joram said, Make ready.  [And] his chariot was made ready.  [And] Joram king of Israel [and] Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, [and] they went out against Jehu, [and] met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2kings:9:22: [And] it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu?  [And] he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel [and] her witchcrafts are so many? 
2kings:9:23: [And] Joram turned his hands, [and] fled, [and] said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. 
2kings:9:24: [And] Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, [and] smote Jehoram between his arms, [and] the arrow went out at his heart, [and] he sunk down in his chariot. 
2kings:9:25: Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, [and] cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I [and] thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; 
2kings:9:26: Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, [and] the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; [and] I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD.  Now therefore take [and] cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD. 
2kings:9:27: But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.  [And] Jehu followed after him, [and] said, Smite him also in the chariot.  [And] they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  [And] he fled to Megiddo, [and] died there. 
2kings:9:28: [And] his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, [and] buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 
2kings:9:29: [And] in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. 
2kings:9:30: [And] when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; [and] she painted her face, [and] tired her head, [and] looked out at a window. 
2kings:9:31: [And] as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master? 
2kings:9:32: [And] he lifted up his face to the window, [and] said, Who is on my side?  who?  [And] there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. 
2kings:9:33: [And] he said, Throw her down.  So they threw her down: [and] some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, [and] on the horses: [and] he trode her under foot. 
2kings:9:34: [And] when he was come in, he did eat [and] drink, [and] said, Go, see now this cursed woman, [and] bury her: for she is a king's daughter. 
2kings:9:35: [And] they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, [and] the feet, [and] the palms of her hands. 
2kings:9:36: Wherefore they came again, [and] told him.  [And] he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: 
2kings:9:37: [And] the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel. 
2kings:10:1: [And] Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.  [And] Jehu wrote letters, [and] sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, [and] to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying, 
2kings:10:2: Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, [and] there are with you chariots [and] horses, a fenced city also, [and] armour;  
2kings:10:3: Look even out the best [and] meetest of your master's sons, [and] set him on his father's throne, [and] fight for your master's house. 
2kings:10:4: But they were exceedingly afraid, [and] said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?  
2kings:10:5: [And] he that was over the house, [and] he that was over the city, the elders also, [and] the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, [and] will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.  
2kings:10:6: Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, [and] if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, [and] come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.  Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up. 
2kings:10:7: [And] it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, [and] slew seventy persons, [and] put their heads in baskets, [and] sent him them to Jezreel. 
2kings:10:8: [And] there came a messenger, [and] told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons.  [And] he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
2kings:10:9: [And] it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, [and] stood, [and] said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, [and] slew him: but who slew all these? 
2kings:10:11: So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, [and] all his great men, [and] his kinsfolks, [and] his priests, until he left him none remaining. 
2kings:10:12: [And] he arose [and] departed, [and] came to Samaria.  [And] as he was at the shearing house in the way, 
2kings:10:13: Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, [and] said, Who are ye?  [And] they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; [and] we go down to salute the children of the king [and] the children of the queen. 
2kings:10:14: [And] he said, Take them alive.  [And] they took them alive, [and] slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two [and] forty men; neither left he any of them. 
2kings:10:15: [And] when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: [and] he saluted him, [and] said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?  [And] Jehonadab answered, It is.  If it be, give me thine hand.  [And] he gave him his hand; [and] he took him up to him into the chariot. 
2kings:10:16: [And] he said, Come with me, [and] see my zeal for the LORD.  So they made him ride in his chariot. 
2kings:10:17: [And] when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah. 
2kings:10:18: [And] Jehu gathered all the people together, [and] said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much. 
2kings:10:19: Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, [and] all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.  But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. 
2kings:10:20: [And] Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.  [And] they proclaimed it. 
2kings:10:21: [And] Jehu sent through all Israel: [and] all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not.  [And] they came into the house of Baal; [and] the house of Baal was full from one end to another. 
2kings:10:22: [And] he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.  [And] he brought them forth vestments. 
2kings:10:23: [And] Jehu went, [and] Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, [and] said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, [and] look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only. 
2kings:10:24: [And] when they went in to offer sacrifices [and] burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, [and] said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him. 
2kings:10:25: [And] it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard [and] to the captains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth.  [And] they smote them with the edge of the sword; [and] the guard [and] the captains cast them out, [and] went to the city of the house of Baal.  
2kings:10:26: [And] they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, [and] burned them. 
2kings:10:27: [And] they brake down the image of Baal, [and] brake down the house of Baal, [and] made it a draught house unto this day.  
2kings:10:29: Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, [and] that were in Dan. 
2kings:10:30: [And] the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, [and] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. 
2kings:10:31: But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD [God] of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. 
2kings:10:32: In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: [and] Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; 
2kings:10:33: From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, [and] the Reubenites, [and] the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead [and] Bashan. 
2kings:10:34: Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, [and] all that he did, [and] all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2kings:10:35: [And] Jehu slept with his fathers: [and] they buried him in Samaria.  [And] Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:10:36: [And] the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty [and] eight years. 
2kings:11:1: [And] when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose [and] destroyed all the seed royal. 
2kings:11:2: But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah [and] stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; [and] they hid him, even him [and] his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 
2kings:11:3: [And] he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.  [And] Athaliah did reign over the land. 
2kings:11:4: [And] the seventh year Jehoiada sent [and] fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains [and] the guard, [and] brought them to him into the house of the LORD, [and] made a covenant with them, [and] took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, [and] shewed them the king's son. 
2kings:11:5: [And] he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; 
2kings:11:6: [And] a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; [and] a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. 
2kings:11:7: [And] two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. 
2kings:11:8: [And] ye shall compass the king around about, every man with his weapons in his hand: [and] he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: [and] be ye with the king as he goeth out [and] as he cometh in. 
2kings:11:9: [And] the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: [and] they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, [and] came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2kings:11:10: [And] to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears [and] shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.  
2kings:11:11: [And] the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar [and] the temple. 
2kings:11:12: [And] he brought forth the king's son, [and] put the crown upon him, [and] gave him the testimony; [and] they made him king, [and] anointed him; [and] they clapped their hands, [and] said, [God] save the king.  
2kings:11:13: [And] when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and] of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.  
2kings:11:14: [And] when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, [and] the princes [and] the trumpeters by the king, [and] all the people of the land rejoiced, [and] blew with trumpets: [and] Athaliah rent her clothes, [and] cried, Treason, Treason. 
2kings:11:15: But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, [and] said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: [and] him that followeth her kill with the sword.  For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. 
2kings:11:16: [And] they laid hands on her; [and] she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: [and] there was she slain. 
2kings:11:17: [And] Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD [and] the king [and] the people that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also [and] the people. 
2kings:11:18: [And] all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, [and] brake it down; his altars [and] his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, [and] slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  [And] the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. 
2kings:11:19: [And] he took the rulers over hundreds, [and] the captains, [and] the guard, [and] all the people of the land; [and] they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, [and] came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.  [And] he sat on the throne of the kings. 
2kings:11:20: [And] all the people of the land rejoiced, [and] the city was in quiet: [and] they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house. 
2kings:12:1: In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; [and] forty years reigned he in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2kings:12:2: [And] Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
2kings:12:3: But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed [and] burnt incense in the high places. 
2kings:12:4: [And] Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, [and] all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD, 
2kings:12:5: Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: [and] let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. 
2kings:12:6: But it was so, that in the three [and] twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 
2kings:12:7: Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, [and] the other priests, [and] said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?  now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. 
2kings:12:8: [And] the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. 
2kings:12:9: But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, [and] bored a hole in the lid of it, [and] set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: [and] the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. 
2kings:12:10: [And] it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe [and] the high priest came up, [and] they put up in bags, [and] told the money that was found in the house of the LORD. 
2kings:12:11: [And] they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: [and] they laid it out to the carpenters [and] builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,  
2kings:12:12: [And] to masons, [and] hewers of stone, [and] to buy timber [and] hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, [and] for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. 
2kings:12:14: But they gave that to the workmen, [and] repaired therewith the house of the LORD.  
2kings:12:16: The trespass money [and] sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'. 
2kings:12:17: Then Hazael king of Syria went up, [and] fought against Gath, [and] took it: [and] Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
2kings:12:18: [And] Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, [and] Jehoram, [and] Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, [and] his own hallowed things, [and] all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, [and] in the king's house, [and] sent it to Hazael king of Syria: [and] he went away from Jerusalem. 
2kings:12:19: [And] the rest of the acts of Joash, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:12:20: [And] his servants arose, [and] made a conspiracy, [and] slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. 
2kings:12:21: For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, [and] Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, [and] he died; [and] they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: [and] Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:13:1: In the three [and] twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and] reigned seventeen years. 
2kings:13:2: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, [and] followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
2kings:13:3: [And] the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, [and] he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, [and] into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days. 
2kings:13:4: [And] Jehoahaz besought the LORD, [and] the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. 
2kings:13:5: (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: [and] the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime. 
2kings:13:6: Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: [and] there remained the grove also in Samaria.) 
2kings:13:7: Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, [and] ten chariots, [and] ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, [and] had made them like the dust by threshing. 
2kings:13:8: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, [and] all that he did, [and] his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2kings:13:9: [And] Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; [and] they buried him in Samaria: [and] Joash his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:13:10: In the thirty [and] seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and] reigned sixteen years. 
2kings:13:11: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein. 
2kings:13:12: [And] the rest of the acts of Joash, [and] all that he did, [and] his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  
2kings:13:13: [And] Joash slept with his fathers; [and] Jeroboam sat upon his throne: [and] Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
2kings:13:14: Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.  [And] Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, [and] wept over his face, [and] said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, [and] the horsemen thereof.  
2kings:13:15: [And] Elisha said unto him, Take bow [and] arrows.  [And] he took unto him bow [and] arrows.  
2kings:13:16: [And] he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.  [And] he put his hand upon it: [and] Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. 
2kings:13:17: [And] he said, Open the window eastward.  [And] he opened it.  Then Elisha said, Shoot.  [And] he shot.  [And] he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, [and] the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. 
2kings:13:18: [And] he said, Take the arrows.  [And] he took them.  [And] he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground.  [And] he smote thrice, [and] stayed. 
2kings:13:19: [And] the man of [God] was wroth with him, [and] said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice. 
2kings:13:20: [And] Elisha died, [and] they buried him.  [And] the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
2kings:13:21: [And] it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; [and] they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: [and] when the man was let down, [and] touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, [and] stood up on his feet. 
2kings:13:23: [And] the LORD was gracious unto them, [and] had compassion on them, [and] had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, [and] Jacob, [and] would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. 
2kings:13:24: So Hazael king of Syria died; [and] Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:13:25: [And] Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.  Three times did Joash beat him, [and] recovered the cities of Israel. 
2kings:14:2: He was twenty [and] five years old when he began to reign, [and] reigned twenty [and] nine years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2kings:14:3: [And] he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did. 
2kings:14:4: Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice [and] burnt incense on the high places. 
2kings:14:5: [And] it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. 
2kings:14:7: He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, [and] took Selah by war, [and] called the name of it Joktheel unto this day. 
2kings:14:9: [And] Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: [and] there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, [and] trode down the thistle. 
2kings:14:10: Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, [and] thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, [and] tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, [and] Judah with thee?  
2kings:14:11: But Amaziah would not hear.  Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; [and] he [and] Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
2kings:14:12: [And] Judah was put to the worse before Israel; [and] they fled every man to their tents.  
2kings:14:13: [And] Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, [and] came to Jerusalem, [and] brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.  
2kings:14:14: [And] he took all the gold [and] silver, [and] all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, [and] in the treasures of the king's house, [and] hostages, [and] returned to Samaria. 
2kings:14:15: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, [and] his might, [and] how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2kings:14:16: [And] Jehoash slept with his fathers, [and] was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; [and] Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:14:17: [And] Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
2kings:14:18: [And] the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:14:19: Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: [and] he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, [and] slew him there. 
2kings:14:20: [And] they brought him on horses: [and] he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
2kings:14:21: [And] all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, [and] made him king instead of his father Amaziah. 
2kings:14:22: He built Elath, [and] restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
2kings:14:23: In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, [and] reigned forty [and] one years. 
2kings:14:24: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
2kings:14:25: He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD [God] of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gath-hepher. 
2kings:14:27: [And] the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 
2kings:14:28: Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, [and] all that he did, [and] his might, how he warred, [and] how he recovered Damascus, [and] Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2kings:14:29: [And] Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; [and] Zachariah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:15:1: In the twenty [and] seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. 
2kings:15:2: Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, [and] he reigned two [and] fifty years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. 
2kings:15:3: [And] he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;  
2kings:15:4: Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed [and] burnt incense still on the high places. 
2kings:15:5: [And] the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, [and] dwelt in a several house.  [And] Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.  
2kings:15:6: [And] the rest of the acts of Azariah, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
2kings:15:7: So Azariah slept with his fathers; [and] they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: [and] Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:15:8: In the thirty [and] eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 
2kings:15:9: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
2kings:15:10: [And] Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, [and] smote him before the people, [and] slew him, [and] reigned in his stead. 
2kings:15:11: [And] the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
2kings:15:12: This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation.  [And] so it came to pass. 
2kings:15:13: Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine [and] thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; [and] he reigned a full month in Samaria. 
2kings:15:14: For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, [and] came to Samaria, [and] smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, [and] slew him, [and] reigned in his stead. 
2kings:15:15: [And] the rest of the acts of Shallum, [and] his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
2kings:15:16: Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, [and] all that were therein, [and] the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; [and] all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. 
2kings:15:17: In the nine [and] thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, [and] reigned ten years in Samaria. 
2kings:15:18: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
2kings:15:19: [And] Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: [and] Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 
2kings:15:20: [And] Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria.  So the king of Assyria turned back, [and] stayed not there in the land. 
2kings:15:21: [And] the rest of the acts of Menahem, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2kings:15:22: [And] Menahem slept with his fathers; [and] Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:15:23: In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and] reigned two years. 
2kings:15:24: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
2kings:15:25: But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, [and] smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob [and] Arieh, [and] with him fifty men of the Gileadites: [and] he killed him, [and] reigned in his room. 
2kings:15:26: [And] the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, [and] all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.  
2kings:15:27: In the two [and] fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and] reigned twenty years. 
2kings:15:28: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.  
2kings:15:29: In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, [and] took Ijon, [and] Abel-beth-maachah, [and] Jonoah, [and] Kedesh, [and] Hazor, [and] Gilead, [and] Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, [and] carried them captive to Assyria.  
2kings:15:30: [And] Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, [and] smote him, [and] slew him, [and] reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
2kings:15:31: [And] the rest of the acts of Pekah, [and] all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
2kings:15:33: Five [and] twenty years old was he when he began to reign, [and] he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 
2kings:15:34: [And] he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 
2kings:15:35: Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed [and] burned incense still in the high places.  He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. 
2kings:15:36: Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:15:37: In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, [and] Pekah the son of Remaliah. 
2kings:15:38: [And] Jotham slept with his fathers, [and] was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: [and] Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:16:2: Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, [and] reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, [and] did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his [God,] like David his father. 
2kings:16:3: But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, [and] made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. 
2kings:16:4: [And] he sacrificed [and] burnt incense in the high places, [and] on the hills, [and] under every green tree. 
2kings:16:5: Then Rezin king of Syria [and] Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: [and] they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. 
2kings:16:6: At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, [and] drave the Jews from Elath: [and] the Syrians came to Elath, [and] dwelt there unto this day. 
2kings:16:7: So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant [and] thy son: come up, [and] save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, [and] out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me. 
2kings:16:8: [And] Ahaz took the silver [and] gold that was found in the house of the LORD, [and] in the treasures of the king's house, [and] sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. 
2kings:16:9: [And] the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, [and] took it, [and] carried the people of it captive to Kir, [and] slew Rezin. 
2kings:16:10: [And] king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, [and] saw an altar that was at Damascus: [and] king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, [and] the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.  
2kings:16:11: [And] Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus. 
2kings:16:12: [And] when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: [and] the king approached to the altar, [and] offered thereon. 
2kings:16:13: [and] he burnt his burnt offering [and] his meat offering, [and] poured his drink offering, [and] sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar. 
2kings:16:14: [And] he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar [and] the house of the LORD, [and] put it on the north side of the altar. 
2kings:16:15: [And] king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, [and] the evening meat offering, [and] the king's burnt sacrifice, [and] his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, [and] their meat offering, [and] their drink offerings; [and] sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, [and] all the blood of the sacrifice: [and] the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.  
2kings:16:17: [And] king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, [and] removed the laver from off them; [and] took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, [and] put it upon a pavement of stones.  
2kings:16:18: [And] the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, [and] the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.  
2kings:16:20: [And] Ahaz slept with his fathers, [and] was buried with his fathers in the city of David: [and] Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:17:2: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him. 
2kings:17:3: Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; [and] Hoshea became his servant, [and] gave him presents. 
2kings:17:4: [And] the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, [and] brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, [and] bound him in prison. 
2kings:17:5: Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, [and] went up to Samaria, [and] besieged it three years. 
2kings:17:6: In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, [and] carried Israel away into Assyria, [and] placed them in Halah [and] in Habor by the river of Gozan, [and] in the cities of the Medes. 
2kings:17:7: For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their [God,] which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, [and] had feared other gods, 
2kings:17:8: [And] walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, [and] of the kings of Israel, which they had made. 
2kings:17:9: [And] the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their [God,] [and] they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 
2kings:17:10: [And] they set them up images [and] groves in every high hill, [and] under every green tree: 
2kings:17:11: [And] there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; [and] wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 
2kings:17:13: Yet the LORD testified against Israel, [and] against Judah, by all the prophets, [and] by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, [and] keep my commandments [and] my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, [and] which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. 
2kings:17:14: Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their [God.] 
2kings:17:15: [And] they rejected his statutes, [and] his covenant that he made with their fathers, [and] his testimonies which he testified against them; [and] they followed vanity, [and] became vain, [and] went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them. 
2kings:17:16: [And] they left all the commandments of the LORD their [God,] [and] made them molten images, even two calves, [and] made a grove, [and] worshipped all the host of heaven, [and] served Baal. 
2kings:17:17: [And] they caused their sons [and] their daughters to pass through the fire, [and] used divination [and] enchantments, [and] sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.  
2kings:17:18: Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, [and] removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. 
2kings:17:19: Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their [God,] but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.  
2kings:17:20: [And] the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, [and] afflicted them, [and] delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.  
2kings:17:21: For he rent Israel from the house of David; [and] they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: [and] Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, [and] made them sin a great sin. 
2kings:17:24: [And] the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, [and] from Cuthah, [and] from Ava, [and] from Hamath, [and] from Sepharvaim, [and] placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: [and] they possessed Samaria, [and] dwelt in the cities thereof. 
2kings:17:25: [And] so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them. 
2kings:17:26: Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, [and] placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the [God] of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, [and,] behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the [God] of the land. 
2kings:17:27: Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; [and] let them go [and] dwell there, [and] let him teach them the manner of the [God] of the land. 
2kings:17:28: Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came [and] dwelt in Bethel, [and] taught them how they should fear the LORD. 
2kings:17:29: Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, [and] put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 
2kings:17:30: [And] the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, [and] the men of Cuth made Nergal, [and] the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2kings:17:31: [And] the Avites made Nibhaz [and] Tartak, [and] the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech [and] Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2kings:17:32: So they feared the LORD, [and] made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 
2kings:17:33: They feared the LORD, [and] served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence. 
2kings:17:34: Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law [and] commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 
2kings:17:35: With whom the LORD had made a covenant, [and] charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 
2kings:17:36: But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power [and] a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, [and] him shall ye worship, [and] to him shall ye do sacrifice. 
2kings:17:37: [And] the statutes, [and] the ordinances, [and] the law, [and] the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; [and] ye shall not fear other gods. 
2kings:17:38: [And] the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. 
2kings:17:39: But the LORD your [God] ye shall fear; [and] he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. 
2kings:17:41: So these nations feared the LORD, [and] served their graven images, both their children, [and] their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day. 
2kings:18:2: Twenty [and] five years old was he when he began to reign; [and] he reigned twenty [and] nine years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. 
2kings:18:3: [And] he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did. 
2kings:18:4: He removed the high places, [and] brake the images, [and] cut down the groves, [and] brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: [and] he called it Nehushtan. 
2kings:18:5: He trusted in the LORD [God] of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him. 
2kings:18:6: For he clave to the LORD, [and] departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. 
2kings:18:7: [And] the LORD was with him; [and] he prospered whithersoever he went forth: [and] he rebelled against the king of Assyria, [and] served him not. 
2kings:18:8: He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, [and] the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 
2kings:18:9: [And] it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, [and] besieged it. 
2kings:18:10: [And] at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
2kings:18:11: [And] the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, [and] put them in Halah [and] in Habor by the river of Gozan, [and] in the cities of the Medes: 
2kings:18:12: Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their [God,] but transgressed his covenant, [and] all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, [and] would not hear them, nor do them. 
2kings:18:13: Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, [and] took them. 
2kings:18:14: [And] Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear.  [And] the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver [and] thirty talents of gold. 
2kings:18:15: [And] Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, [and] in the treasures of the king's house. 
2kings:18:16: At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, [and] from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, [and] gave it to the king of Assyria. 
2kings:18:17: [And] the king of Assyria sent Tartan [and] Rabsaris [and] Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.  [And] they went up [and] came to Jerusalem.  [And] when they were come up, they came [and] stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field. 
2kings:18:18: [And] when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, [and] Shebna the scribe, [and] Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. 
2kings:18:19: [And] Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 
2kings:18:20: Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel [and] strength for the war.  Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 
2kings:18:21: Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, [and] pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.  
2kings:18:22: But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places [and] whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, [and] hath said to Judah [and] Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 
2kings:18:23: Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, [and] I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.  
2kings:18:24: How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, [and] put thy trust on Egypt for chariots [and] for horsemen?  
2kings:18:25: Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, [and] destroy it. 
2kings:18:26: Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, [and] Shebna, [and] Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: [and] talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. 
2kings:18:27: But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, [and] to thee, to speak these words?  hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, [and] drink their own piss with you. 
2kings:18:28: Then Rab-shakeh stood [and] cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, [and] spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: 
2kings:18:30: Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, [and] this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2kings:18:31: Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, [and] come out to me, [and] then eat ye every man of his own vine, [and] every one of his fig tree, [and] drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 
2kings:18:32: Until I come [and] take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn [and] wine, a land of bread [and] vineyards, a land of oil olive [and] of honey, that ye may live, [and] not die: [and] hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. 
2kings:18:34: Where are the gods of Hamath, [and] of Arpad?  where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, [and] Ivah?  have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? 
2kings:18:36: But the people held their peace, [and] answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
2kings:18:37: Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, [and] Shebna the scribe, [and] Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, [and] told him the words of Rab-shakeh. 
2kings:19:1: [And] it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, [and] covered himself with sackcloth, [and] went into the house of the LORD. 
2kings:19:2: [And] he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, [and] Shebna the scribe, [and] the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
2kings:19:3: [And] they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, [and] of rebuke, [and] blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, [and] there is not strength to bring forth. 
2kings:19:4: It may be the LORD thy [God] will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living [God;] [and] will reprove the words which the LORD thy [God] hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left. 
2kings:19:6: [And] Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.  
2kings:19:7: Behold, I will send a blast upon him, [and] he shall hear a rumour, [and] shall return to his own land; [and] I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. 
2kings:19:8: So Rab-shakeh returned, [and] found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.  
2kings:19:9: [And] when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,  
2kings:19:10: Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy [God] in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2kings:19:11: Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: [and] shalt thou be delivered? 
2kings:19:12: Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, [and] Haran, [and] Rezeph, [and] the children of Eden which were in Thelasar? 
2kings:19:13: Where is the king of Hamath, [and] the king of Arpad, [and] the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, [and] Ivah? 
2kings:19:14: [And] Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, [and] read it: [and] Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, [and] spread it before the LORD. 
2kings:19:15: [And] Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, [and] said, O LORD [God] of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the [God,] even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven [and] earth. 
2kings:19:16: LORD, bow down thine ear, [and] hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, [and] see: [and] hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living [God.] 
2kings:19:17: Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations [and] their lands, 
2kings:19:18: [And] have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood [and] stone: therefore they have destroyed them. 
2kings:19:19: Now therefore, O LORD our [God,] I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD [God,] even thou only. 
2kings:19:20: Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 
2kings:19:21: This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
2kings:19:22: Whom hast thou reproached [and] blasphemed?  [and] against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, [and] lifted up thine eyes on high?  even against the Holy One of Israel. 
2kings:19:23: By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, [and] hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, [and] will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: [and] I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, [and] into the forest of his Carmel. 
2kings:19:24: I have digged [and] drunk strange waters, [and] with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. 
2kings:19:25: Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, [and] of ancient times that I have formed it?  now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
2kings:19:26: Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed [and] confounded; they were as the grass of the field, [and] as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, [and] as corn blasted before it be grown up. 
2kings:19:27: But I know thy abode, [and] thy going out, [and] thy coming in, [and] thy rage against me. 
2kings:19:28: Because thy rage against me [and] thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, [and] my bridle in thy lips, [and] I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 
2kings:19:29: [And] this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, [and] in the second year that which springeth of the same; [and] in the third year sow ye, [and] reap, [and] plant vineyards, [and] eat the fruits thereof.  
2kings:19:30: [And] the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, [and] bear fruit upward. 
2kings:19:31: For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, [and] they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.  
2kings:19:33: By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, [and] shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. 
2kings:19:34: For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, [and] for my servant David's sake. 
2kings:19:35: [And] it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, [and] smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore [and] five thousand: [and] when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 
2kings:19:36: So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, [and] went [and] returned, [and] dwelt at Nineveh. 
2kings:19:37: [And] it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his [god,] that Adrammelech [and] Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: [and] they escaped into the land of Armenia.  [And] Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:20:1: In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.  [And] the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, [and] said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, [and] not live. 
2kings:20:2: Then he turned his face to the wall, [and] prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
2kings:20:3: I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth [and] with a perfect heart, [and] have done that which is good in thy sight.  [And] Hezekiah wept sore. 
2kings:20:4: [And] it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 
2kings:20:5: Turn again, [and] tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the [God] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. 
2kings:20:6: [And] I will add unto thy days fifteen years; [and] I will deliver thee [and] this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; [and] I will defend this city for mine own sake, [and] for my servant David's sake. 
2kings:20:7: [And] Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs.  [And] they took [and] laid it on the boil, [and] he recovered. 
2kings:20:8: [And] Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, [and] that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day? 
2kings:20:9: [And] Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forth ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 
2kings:20:10: [And] Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 
2kings:20:11: [And] Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: [and] he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. 
2kings:20:12: At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters [and] a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2kings:20:13: [And] Hezekiah hearkened unto them, [and] shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, [and] the gold, [and] the spices, [and] the precious ointment, [and] all the house of his armour, [and] all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.  
2kings:20:14: Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, [and] said unto him, What said these men?  [and] from whence came they unto thee?  [And] Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon. 
2kings:20:15: [And] he said, What have they seen in thine house?  [And] Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.  
2kings:20:16: [And] Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.  
2kings:20:17: Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, [and] that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 
2kings:20:18: [And] of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; [and] they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
2kings:20:19: Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken.  [And] he said, Is it not good, if peace [and] truth be in my days? 
2kings:20:20: [And] the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, [and] all his might, [and] how he made a pool, [and] a conduit, [and] brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:20:21: [And] Hezekiah slept with his fathers: [and] Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:21:1: Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, [and] reigned fifty [and] five years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Hephzi-bah. 
2kings:21:2: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
2kings:21:3: For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; [and] he reared up altars for Baal, [and] made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; [and] worshipped all the host of heaven, [and] served them. 
2kings:21:4: [And] he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. 
2kings:21:5: [And] he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
2kings:21:6: [And] he made his son pass through the fire, [and] observed times, [and] used enchantments, [and] dealt with familiar spirits [and] wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
2kings:21:7: [And] he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, [and] to Solomon his son, In this house, [and] in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
2kings:21:8: Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, [and] according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. 
2kings:21:9: But they hearkened not: [and] Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. 
2kings:21:10: [And] the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 
2kings:21:11: Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, [and] hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, [and] hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 
2kings:21:12: Therefore thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem [and] Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 
2kings:21:13: [And] I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, [and] the plummet of the house of Ahab: [and] I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, [and] turning it upside down. 
2kings:21:14: [And] I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, [and] deliver them into the hand of their enemies; [and] they shall become a prey [and] a spoil to all their enemies;  
2kings:21:15: Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, [and] have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. 
2kings:21:17: Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, [and] all that he did, [and] his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
2kings:21:18: [And] Manasseh slept with his fathers, [and] was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: [and] Amon his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:21:19: Amon was twenty [and] two years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
2kings:21:20: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did. 
2kings:21:21: [And] he walked in all the way that his father walked in, [and] served the idols that his father served, [and] worshipped them: 
2kings:21:22: [And] he forsook the LORD [God] of his fathers, [and] walked not in the way of the LORD. 
2kings:21:23: [And] the servants of Amon conspired against him, [and] slew the king in his own house. 
2kings:21:24: [And] the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; [and] the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
2kings:21:26: [And] he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: [and] Josiah his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:22:1: Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned thirty [and] one years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 
2kings:22:2: [And] he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, [and] walked in all the way of David his father, [and] turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 
2kings:22:3: [And] it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 
2kings:22:5: [And] let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: [and] let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, 
2kings:22:6: Unto carpenters, [and] builders, [and] masons, [and] to buy timber [and] hewn stone to repair the house. 
2kings:22:8: [And] Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.  [And] Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, [and] he read it. 
2kings:22:9: [And] Shaphan the scribe came to the king, [and] brought the king word again, [and] said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, [and] have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. 
2kings:22:10: [And] Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.  [And] Shaphan read it before the king.  
2kings:22:11: [And] it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
2kings:22:12: [And] the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, [and] Ahikam the son of Shaphan, [and] Achbor the son of Michaiah, [and] Shaphan the scribe, [and] Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,  
2kings:22:13: Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, [and] for the people, [and] for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.  
2kings:22:14: So Hilkiah the priest, [and] Ahikam, [and] Achbor, [and] Shaphan, [and] Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) [and] they communed with her. 
2kings:22:15: [And] she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me, 
2kings:22:16: Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, [and] upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 
2kings:22:17: Because they have forsaken me, [and] have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, [and] shall not be quenched. 
2kings:22:18: But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD [God] of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard; 
2kings:22:19: Because thine heart was tender, [and] thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, [and] against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation [and] a curse, [and] hast rent thy clothes, [and] wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. 
2kings:22:20: Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, [and] thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; [and] thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.  [And] they brought the king word again. 
2kings:23:1: [And] the king sent, [and] they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah [and] of Jerusalem. 
2kings:23:2: [And] the king went up into the house of the LORD, [and] all the men of Judah [and] all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, [and] the priests, [and] the prophets, [and] all the people, both small [and] great: [and] he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. 
2kings:23:3: [And] the king stood by a pillar, [and] made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, [and] to keep his commandments [and] his testimonies [and] his statutes with all their heart [and] all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.  [And] all the people stood to the covenant. 
2kings:23:4: [And] the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, [and] the priests of the second order, [and] the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, [and] for the grove, [and] for all the host of heaven: [and] he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, [and] carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. 
2kings:23:5: [And] he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, [and] in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, [and] to the moon, [and] to the planets, [and] to all the host of heaven. 
2kings:23:6: [And] he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, [and] burned it at the brook Kidron, [and] stamped it small to powder, [and] cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 
2kings:23:7: [And] he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. 
2kings:23:8: [And] he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, [and] defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, [and] brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 
2kings:23:10: [And] he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 
2kings:23:11: [And] he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, [and] burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  
2kings:23:12: [And] the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, [and] the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, [and] brake them down from thence, [and] cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.  
2kings:23:13: [And] the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, [and] for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, [and] for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. 
2kings:23:14: [And] he brake in pieces the images, [and] cut down the groves, [and] filled their places with the bones of men. 
2kings:23:15: Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, [and] the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar [and] the high place he brake down, [and] burned the high place, [and] stamped it small to powder, [and] burned the grove. 
2kings:23:16: [And] as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, [and] sent, [and] took the bones out of the sepulchres, [and] burned them upon the altar, [and] polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of [God] proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. 
2kings:23:17: Then he said, What title is that that I see?  [And] the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of [God,] which came from Judah, [and] proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. 
2kings:23:18: [And] he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones.  So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 
2kings:23:19: [And] all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, [and] did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. 
2kings:23:20: [And] he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, [and] burned men's bones upon them, [and] returned to Jerusalem. 
2kings:23:21: [And] the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your [God,] as it is written in the book of this covenant. 
2kings:23:24: Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, [and] the wizards, [and] the images, [and] the idols, [and] all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah [and] in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 
2kings:23:25: [And] like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, [and] with all his soul, [and] with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. 
2kings:23:27: [And] the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, [and] will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, [and] the house of which I said, My name shall be there. 
2kings:23:28: Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:23:29: In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: [and] king Josiah went against him; [and] he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
2kings:23:30: [And] his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, [and] brought him to Jerusalem, [and] buried him in his own sepulchre.  [And] the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, [and] anointed him, [and] made him king in his father's stead. 
2kings:23:31: Jehoahaz was twenty [and] three years old when he began to reign; [and] he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2kings:23:32: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.  
2kings:23:33: [And] Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; [and] put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, [and] a talent of gold. 
2kings:23:34: [And] Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, [and] turned his name to Jehoiakim, [and] took Jehoahaz away: [and] he came to Egypt, [and] died there.  
2kings:23:35: [And] Jehoiakim gave the silver [and] the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver [and] the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-nechoh.  
2kings:23:36: Jehoiakim was twenty [and] five years old when he began to reign; [and] he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
2kings:23:37: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. 
2kings:24:1: In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, [and] Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned [and] rebelled against him. 
2kings:24:2: [And] the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, [and] bands of the Syrians, [and] bands of the Moabites, [and] bands of the children of Ammon, [and] sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets. 
2kings:24:4: [And] also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon. 
2kings:24:5: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, [and] all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2kings:24:6: So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: [and] Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
2kings:24:7: [And] the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt. 
2kings:24:8: Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned in Jerusalem three months.  [And] his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
2kings:24:9: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. 
2kings:24:10: At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, [and] the city was besieged. 
2kings:24:11: [And] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, [and] his servants did besiege it. 
2kings:24:12: [And] Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, [and] his mother, [and] his servants, [and] his princes, [and] his officers: [and] the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 
2kings:24:13: [And] he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, [and] the treasures of the king's house, [and] cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. 
2kings:24:14: [And] he carried away all Jerusalem, [and] all the princes, [and] all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, [and] all the craftsmen [and] smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
2kings:24:15: [And] he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, [and] the king's mother, [and] the king's wives, [and] his officers, [and] the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2kings:24:16: [And] all the men of might, even seven thousand, [and] craftsmen [and] smiths a thousand, all that were strong [and] apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 
2kings:24:17: [And] the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, [and] changed his name to Zedekiah.  
2kings:24:18: Zedekiah was twenty [and] one years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  [And] his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2kings:24:19: [And] he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.  
2kings:24:20: For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem [and] Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.  
2kings:25:1: [And] it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, [and] all his host, against Jerusalem, [and] pitched against it; [and] they built forts against it round about. 
2kings:25:2: [And] the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
2kings:25:3: [And] on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, [and] there was no bread for the people of the land. 
2kings:25:4: [And] the city was broken up, [and] all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) [and] the king went the way toward the plain. 
2kings:25:5: [And] the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, [and] overtook him in the plains of Jericho: [and] all his army were scattered from him. 
2kings:25:6: So they took the king, [and] brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; [and] they gave judgment upon him. 
2kings:25:7: [And] they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, [and] put out the eyes of Zedekiah, [and] bound him with fetters of brass, [and] carried him to Babylon. 
2kings:25:8: [And] in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: 
2kings:25:9: [And] he burnt the house of the LORD, [and] the king's house, [and] all the houses of Jerusalem, [and] every great man's house burnt he with fire. 
2kings:25:10: [And] all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
2kings:25:11: Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, [and] the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away. 
2kings:25:12: But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers [and] husbandmen. 
2kings:25:13: [And] the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, [and] the bases, [and] the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, [and] carried the brass of them to Babylon. 
2kings:25:14: [And] the pots, [and] the shovels, [and] the snuffers, [and] the spoons, [and] all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.  
2kings:25:15: [And] the firepans, [and] the bowls, [and] such things as were of gold, in gold, [and] of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. 
2kings:25:16: The two pillars, one sea, [and] the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.  
2kings:25:17: The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, [and] the chapiter upon it was brass: [and] the height of the chapiter three cubits; [and] the wreathen work, [and] pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: [and] like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.  
2kings:25:18: [And] the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, [and] Zephaniah the second priest, [and] the three keepers of the door: 
2kings:25:19: [And] out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, [and] five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, [and] the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, [and] threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city: 
2kings:25:20: [And] Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, [and] brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: 
2kings:25:21: [And] the king of Babylon smote them, [and] slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath.  So Judah was carried away out of their land. 
2kings:25:22: [And] as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. 
2kings:25:23: [And] when all the captains of the armies, they [and] their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethahiah, [and] Johanan the son of Careah, [and] Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, [and] Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they [and] their men. 
2kings:25:24: [And] Gedaliah sware to them, [and] to their men, [and] said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, [and] serve the king of Babylon; [and] it shall be well with you. 
2kings:25:25: But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, [and] ten men with him, [and] smote Gedaliah, that he died, [and] the Jews [and] the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. 
2kings:25:26: [And] all the people, both small [and] great, [and] the captains of the armies, arose, [and] came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees. 
2kings:25:27: [And] it came to pass in the seven [and] thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven [and] twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 
2kings:25:28: [And] he spake kindly to him, [and] set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon; 
2kings:25:29: [And] changed his prison garments: [and] he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life. 
2kings:25:30: [And] his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life. 
ezra:1:1: Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, [and] put it also in writing, saying, 
ezra:1:2: Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD [God] of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; [and] he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.  
ezra:1:3: Who is there among you of all his people?  his [God] be with him, [and] let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, [and] build the house of the LORD [God] of Israel, (he is the [God,)] which is in Jerusalem. 
ezra:1:4: [And] whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, [and] with gold, [and] with goods, [and] with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of [God] that is in Jerusalem.  
ezra:1:5: Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah [and] Benjamin, [and] the priests, [and] the Levites, with all them whose spirit [God] had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.  
ezra:1:6: [And] all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, [and] with beasts, [and] with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. 
ezra:1:7: Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, [and] had put them in the house of his gods; 
ezra:1:8: Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, [and] numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 
ezra:1:9: [And] this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine [and] twenty knives, 
ezra:1:10: Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred [and] ten, [and] other vessels a thousand. 
ezra:1:11: All the vessels of gold [and] of silver were five thousand [and] four hundred.  All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. 
ezra:2:1: Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, [and] came again unto Jerusalem [and] Judah, every one unto his city; 
ezra:2:3: The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy [and] two. 
ezra:2:4: The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy [and] two. 
ezra:2:5: The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy [and] five. 
ezra:2:6: The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua [and] Joab, two thousand eight hundred [and] twelve. 
ezra:2:7: The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty [and] four. 
ezra:2:8: The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty [and] five. 
ezra:2:9: The children of Zaccai, seven hundred [and] threescore. 
ezra:2:10: The children of Bani, six hundred forty [and] two. 
ezra:2:11: The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty [and] three. 
ezra:2:12: The children of Azgad, a thousand two hundred twenty [and] two. 
ezra:2:13: The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty [and] six.  
ezra:2:14: The children of Bigvai, two thousand fifty [and] six. 
ezra:2:15: The children of Adin, four hundred fifty [and] four.  
ezra:2:16: The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety [and] eight.  
ezra:2:17: The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty [and] three. 
ezra:2:18: The children of Jorah, an hundred [and] twelve. 
ezra:2:19: The children of Hashum, two hundred twenty [and] three. 
ezra:2:20: The children of Gibbar, ninety [and] five. 
ezra:2:21: The children of Bethlehem, an hundred twenty [and] three. 
ezra:2:22: The men of Netophah, fifty [and] six. 
ezra:2:23: The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty [and] eight. 
ezra:2:24: The children of Azmaveth, forty [and] two. 
ezra:2:25: The children of Kirjath-arim, Chephirah, [and] Beeroth, seven hundred [and] forty [and] three.

ezra:2:58: All the Nethinims, [and] the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety [and] two. 
ezra:2:59: [And] these were they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, [and] Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, [and] their seed, whether they were of Israel:  
ezra:2:60: The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty [and] two. 
ezra:2:61: [And] of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, [and] was called after their name:  
ezra:2:63: [And] the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim [and] with Thummim. 
ezra:2:64: The whole congregation together was forty [and] two thousand three hundred [and] threescore, 
ezra:2:65: Beside their servants [and] their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty [and] seven: [and] there were among them two hundred singing men [and] singing women. 
ezra:2:66: Their horses were seven hundred thirty [and] six; their mules, two hundred forty [and] five; 
ezra:2:67: Their camels, four hundred thirty [and] five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred [and] twenty. 
ezra:2:68: [And] some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of [God] to set it up in his place: 
ezra:2:69: They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore [and] one thousand drams of gold, [and] five thousand pound of silver, [and] one hundred priests' garments. 
ezra:2:70: So the priests, [and] the Levites, [and] some of the people, [and] the singers, [and] the porters, [and] the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, [and] all Israel in their cities. 
ezra:3:1: [And] when the seventh month was come, [and] the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
ezra:3:2: Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, [and] his brethren the priests, [and] Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, [and] his brethren, [and] builded the altar of the [God] of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of [God.] 
ezra:3:3: [And] they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: [and] they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning [and] evening. 
ezra:3:4: They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, [and] offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; 
ezra:3:5: [And] afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, [and] of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, [and] of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. 
ezra:3:7: They gave money also unto the masons, [and] to the carpenters; [and] meat, [and] drink, [and] oil, unto them of Zidon, [and] to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. 
ezra:3:8: Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of [God] at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, [and] Jeshua the son of Jozadak, [and] the remnant of their brethren the priests [and] the Levites, [and] all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; [and] appointed the Levites, from twenty years old [and] upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. 
ezra:3:9: Then stood Jeshua with his sons [and] his brethren, Kadmiel [and] his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons [and] their brethren the Levites. 
ezra:3:10: [And] when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, [and] the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 
ezra:3:11: [And] they sang together by course in praising [and] giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.  [And] all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.  
ezra:3:12: But many of the priests [and] Levites [and] chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; [and] many shouted aloud for joy: 
ezra:3:13: So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, [and] the noise was heard afar off.  
ezra:4:1: Now when the adversaries of Judah [and] Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD [God] of Israel; 
ezra:4:2: Then they came to Zerubbabel, [and] to the chief of the fathers, [and] said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your [God,] as ye do; [and] we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. 
ezra:4:3: But Zerubbabel, [and] Jeshua, [and] the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our [God;] but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD [God] of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. 
ezra:4:4: Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, [and] troubled them in building, 
ezra:4:5: [And] hired counsellers against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.  
ezra:4:6: [And] in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah [and] Jerusalem. 
ezra:4:7: [And] in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, [and] the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; [and] the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, [and] interpreted in the Syrian tongue.  
ezra:4:8: Rehum the chancellor [and] Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:  
ezra:4:9: Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, [and] Shimshai the scribe, [and] the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, [and] the Elamites, 
ezra:4:10: [And] the rest of the nations whom the great [and] noble Asnappar brought over, [and] set in the cities of Samaria, [and] the rest that are on this side the river, [and] at such a time. 
ezra:4:11: This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, [and] at such a time. 
ezra:4:12: Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious [and] the bad city, [and] have set up the walls thereof, [and] joined the foundations. 
ezra:4:13: Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, [and] the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, [and] custom, [and] so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. 
ezra:4:14: Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, [and] it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent [and] certified the king; 
ezra:4:15: That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, [and] know that this city is a rebellious city, [and] hurtful unto kings [and] provinces, [and] that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. 
ezra:4:16: We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, [and] the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. 
ezra:4:17: Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, [and] to Shimshai the scribe, [and] to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, [and] unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, [and] at such a time. 
ezra:4:19: [And] I commanded, [and] search hath been made, [and] it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, [and] that rebellion [and] sedition have been made therein. 
ezra:4:20: There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; [and] toll, tribute, [and] custom, was paid unto them. 
ezra:4:21: Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, [and] that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. 
ezra:4:23: Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, [and] Shimshai the scribe, [and] their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, [and] made them to cease by force [and] power. 
ezra:4:24: Then ceased the work of the house of [God] which is at Jerusalem.  So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
ezra:5:1: Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, [and] Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah [and] Jerusalem in the name of the [God] of Israel, even unto them. 
ezra:5:2: Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, [and] Jeshua the son of Jozadak, [and] began to build the house of [God] which is at Jerusalem: [and] with them were the prophets of [God] helping them. 
ezra:5:3: At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, [and] Shethar-boznai, [and] their companions, [and] said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, [and] to make up this wall?  
ezra:5:5: But the eye of their [God] was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: [and] then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.  
ezra:5:6: The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, [and] Shethar-boznai, [and] his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:  
ezra:5:8: Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great [God,] which is builded with great stones, [and] timber is laid in the walls, [and] this work goeth fast on, [and] prospereth in their hands. 
ezra:5:9: Then asked we those elders, [and] said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, [and] to make up these walls? 
ezra:5:11: [And] thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the [God] of heaven [and] earth, [and] build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded [and] set up. 
ezra:5:12: But after that our fathers had provoked the [God] of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, [and] carried the people away into Babylon. 
ezra:5:13: But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of [God.] 
ezra:5:14: [And] the vessels also of gold [and] silver of the house of [God,] which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, [and] brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, [and] they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
ezra:5:15: [And] said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, [and] let the house of [God] be builded in his place. 
ezra:5:16: Then came the same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid the foundation of the house of [God] which is in Jerusalem: [and] since that time even until now hath it been in building, [and] yet it is not finished. 
ezra:5:17: Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of [God] at Jerusalem, [and] let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. 
ezra:6:1: Then Darius the king made a decree, [and] search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
ezra:6:2: [And] there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, [and] therein was a record thus written: 
ezra:6:3: In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of [God] at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, [and] let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 
ezra:6:4: With three rows of great stones, [and] a row of new timber: [and] let the expences be given out of the king's house: 
ezra:6:5: [And] also let the golden [and] silver vessels of the house of [God,] which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, [and] brought unto Babylon, be restored, [and] brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, [and] place them in the house of [God.] 
ezra:6:6: Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, [and] your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 
ezra:6:7: Let the work of this house of [God] alone; let the governor of the Jews [and] the elders of the Jews build this house of [God] in his place. 
ezra:6:9: [And] that which they have need of, both young bullocks, [and] rams, [and] lambs, for the burnt offerings of the [God] of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, [and] oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
ezra:6:10: That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the [God] of heaven, [and] pray for the life of the king, [and] of his sons.  
ezra:6:11: Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, [and] being set up, let him be hanged thereon; [and] let his house be made a dunghill for this.  
ezra:6:12: [And] the [God] that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings [and] people, that shall put to their hand to alter [and] to destroy this house of [God] which is at Jerusalem.  I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. 
ezra:6:13: Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, [and] their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. 
ezra:6:14: [And] the elders of the Jews builded, [and] they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet [and] Zechariah the son of Iddo.  [And] they builded, [and] finished it, according to the commandment of the [God] of Israel, [and] according to the commandment of Cyrus, [and] Darius, [and] Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
ezra:6:15: [And] this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 
ezra:6:16: [And] the children of Israel, the priests, [and] the Levites, [and] the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of [God] with joy, 
ezra:6:17: [And] offered at the dedication of this house of [God] an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; [and] for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
ezra:6:18: [And] they set the priests in their divisions, [and] the Levites in their courses, for the service of [God,] which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. 
ezra:6:19: [And] the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. 
ezra:6:20: For the priests [and] the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, [and] killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, [and] for their brethren the priests, [and] for themselves. 
ezra:6:21: [And] the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, [and] all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD [God] of Israel, did eat, 
ezra:6:22: [And] kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, [and] turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of [God,] the [God] of Israel. 
ezra:7:6: This Ezra went up from Babylon; [and] he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD [God] of Israel had given: [and] the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his [God] upon him.  
ezra:7:7: [And] there went up some of the children of Israel, [and] of the priests, [and] the Levites, [and] the singers, [and] the porters, [and] the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
ezra:7:8: [And] he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
ezra:7:9: For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, [and] on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his [God] upon him. 
ezra:7:10: For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, [and] to do it, [and] to teach in Israel statutes [and] judgments. 
ezra:7:11: Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, [and] of his statutes to Israel. 
ezra:7:12: Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the [God] of heaven, perfect peace, [and] at such a time. 
ezra:7:13: I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, [and] of his priests [and] Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. 
ezra:7:14: Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, [and] of his seven counsellers, to enquire concerning Judah [and] Jerusalem, according to the law of thy [God] which is in thine hand; 
ezra:7:15: [And] to carry the silver [and] gold, which the king [and] his counsellers have freely offered unto the [God] of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 
ezra:7:16: [And] all the silver [and] gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, [and] of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their [God] which is in Jerusalem: 
ezra:7:17: That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings [and] their drink offerings, [and] offer them upon the altar of the house of your [God] which is in Jerusalem. 
ezra:7:18: [And] whatsoever shall seem good to thee, [and] to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver [and] the gold, that do after the will of your [God.] 
ezra:7:19: The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy [God,] those deliver thou before the [God] of Jerusalem. 
ezra:7:20: [And] whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy [God,] which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. 
ezra:7:21: [And] I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the [God] of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, 
ezra:7:22: Unto an hundred talents of silver, [and] to an hundred measures of wheat, [and] to an hundred baths of wine, [and] to an hundred baths of oil, [and] salt without prescribing how much. 
ezra:7:23: Whatsoever is commanded by the [God] of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the [God] of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king [and] his sons? 
ezra:7:24: Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests [and] Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of [God,] it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. 
ezra:7:25: [And] thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy [God,] that is in thine hand, set magistrates [and] judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy [God;] [and] teach ye them that know them not. 
ezra:7:26: [And] whosoever will not do the law of thy [God,] [and] the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.  
ezra:7:27: Blessed be the LORD [God] of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: 
ezra:7:28: [And] hath extended mercy unto me before the king, [and] his counsellers, [and] before all the king's mighty princes.  [And] I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my [God] was upon me, [and] I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.  
ezra:8:1: These are now the chief of their fathers, [and] this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 
ezra:8:3: Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: [and] with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred [and] fifty. 
ezra:8:4: Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, [and] with him two hundred males. 
ezra:8:5: Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, [and] with him three hundred males. 
ezra:8:6: Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, [and] with him fifty males. 
ezra:8:7: [And] of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, [and] with him seventy males. 
ezra:8:8: [And] of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, [and] with him fourscore males. 
ezra:8:9: Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, [and] with him two hundred [and] eighteen males. 
ezra:8:10: [And] of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, [and] with him an hundred [and] threescore males. 
ezra:8:11: [And] of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, [and] with him twenty [and] eight males. 
ezra:8:12: [And] of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, [and] with him an hundred [and] ten males. 
ezra:8:13: [And] of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, [and] Shemaiah, [and] with them threescore males. 
ezra:8:14: Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, [and] Zabbud, [and] with them seventy males. 
ezra:8:15: [And] I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; [and] there abode we in tents three days: [and] I viewed the people, [and] the priests, [and] found there none of the sons of Levi. 
ezra:8:16: Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, [and] for Elnathan, [and] for Jarib, [and] for Elnathan, [and] for Nathan, [and] for Zechariah, [and] for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, [and] for Elnathan, men of understanding. 
ezra:8:17: [And] I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, [and] I told them what they should say unto Iddo, [and] to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our [God.] 
ezra:8:18: [And] by the good hand of our [God] upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; [and] Sherebiah, with his sons [and] his brethren, eighteen; 
ezra:8:19: [And] Hashabiah, [and] with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren [and] their sons, twenty; 
ezra:8:20: Also of the Nethinims, whom David [and] the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred [and] twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.  
ezra:8:21: Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our [God,] to seek of him a right way for us, [and] for our little ones, [and] for all our substance. 
ezra:8:22: For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers [and] horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our [God] is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power [and] his wrath is against all them that forsake him.  
ezra:8:23: So we fasted [and] besought our [God] for this: [and] he was intreated of us.  
ezra:8:24: Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, [and] ten of their brethren with them, 
ezra:8:25: [And] weighed unto them the silver, [and] the gold, [and] the vessels, even the offering of the house of our [God,] which the king, [and] his counsellers, [and] his lords, [and] all Israel there present, had offered: 
ezra:8:26: I even weighed unto their hand six hundred [and] fifty talents of silver, [and] silver vessels an hundred talents, [and] of gold an hundred talents; 
ezra:8:27: Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; [and] two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. 
ezra:8:28: [And] I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; [and] the silver [and] the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD [God] of your fathers. 
ezra:8:29: Watch ye, [and] keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests [and] the Levites, [and] chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 
ezra:8:30: So took the priests [and] the Levites the weight of the silver, [and] the gold, [and] the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our [God.] 
ezra:8:31: Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: [and] the hand of our [God] was upon us, [and] he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, [and] of such as lay in wait by the way. 
ezra:8:32: [And] we came to Jerusalem, [and] abode there three days. 
ezra:8:33: Now on the fourth day was the silver [and] the gold [and] the vessels weighed in the house of our [God] by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; [and] with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; [and] with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, [and] Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; 
ezra:8:34: By number [and] by weight of every one: [and] all the weight was written at that time. 
ezra:8:35: Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the [God] of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety [and] six rams, seventy [and] seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD. 
ezra:8:36: [And] they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, [and] to the governors on this side the river: [and] they furthered the people, [and] the house of [God.] 
ezra:9:1: Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, [and] the priests, [and] the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, [and] the Amorites. 
ezra:9:2: For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, [and] for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes [and] rulers hath been chief in this trespass. 
ezra:9:3: [And] when I heard this thing, I rent my garment [and] my mantle, [and] plucked off the hair of my head [and] of my beard, [and] sat down astonied. 
ezra:9:4: Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the [God] of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; [and] I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. 
ezra:9:5: [And] at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; [and] having rent my garment [and] my mantle, I fell upon my knees, [and] spread out my hands unto the LORD my [God.] 
ezra:9:6: [And] said, O my [God,] I am ashamed [and] blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, [and] our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.  
ezra:9:7: Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; [and] for our iniquities have we, our kings, [and] our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, [and] to a spoil, [and] to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
ezra:9:8: [And] now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our [God,] to leave us a remnant to escape, [and] to give us a nail in his holy place, that our [God] may lighten our eyes, [and] give us a little reviving in our bondage. 
ezra:9:9: For we were bondmen; yet our [God] hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our [God,] [and] to repair the desolations thereof, [and] to give us a wall in Judah [and] in Jerusalem. 
ezra:9:10: [And] now, O our [God,] what shall we say after this?  for we have forsaken thy commandments, 
ezra:9:12: Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, [and] eat the good of the land, [and] leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
ezra:9:13: [And] after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, [and] for our great trespass, seeing that thou our [God] hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, [and] hast given us such deliverance as this;  
ezra:9:14: Should we again break thy commandments, [and] join in affinity with the people of these abominations?  wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?  
ezra:9:15: O LORD [God] of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this. 
ezra:10:1: Now when Ezra had prayed, [and] when he had confessed, weeping [and] casting himself down before the house of [God,] there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men [and] women [and] children: for the people wept very sore. 
ezra:10:2: [And] Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered [and] said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our [God,] [and] have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. 
ezra:10:3: Now therefore let us make a covenant with our [God] to put away all the wives, [and] such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, [and] of those that tremble at the commandment of our [God;] [and] let it be done according to the law. 
ezra:10:4: Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, [and] do it. 
ezra:10:5: Then arose Ezra, [and] made the chief priests, the Levites, [and] all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word.  [And] they sware. 
ezra:10:6: Then Ezra rose up from before the house of [God,] [and] went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: [and] when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. 
ezra:10:7: [And] they made proclamation throughout Judah [and] Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
ezra:10:8: [And] that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes [and] the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, [and] himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. 
ezra:10:9: Then all the men of Judah [and] Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days.  It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; [and] all the people sat in the street of the house of [God,] trembling because of this matter, [and] for the great rain. 
ezra:10:10: [And] Ezra the priest stood up, [and] said unto them, Ye have transgressed, [and] have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. 
ezra:10:11: Now therefore make confession unto the LORD [God] of your fathers, [and] do his pleasure: [and] separate yourselves from the people of the land, [and] from the strange wives. 
ezra:10:12: Then all the congregation answered [and] said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. 
ezra:10:13: But the people are many, [and] it is a time of much rain, [and] we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. 
ezra:10:14: Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, [and] let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, [and] with them the elders of every city, [and] the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our [God] for this matter be turned from us. 
ezra:10:15: Only Jonathan the son of Asahel [and] Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: [and] Meshullam [and] Shabbethai the Levite helped them. 
ezra:10:16: [And] the children of the captivity did so.  [And] Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, [and] all of them by their names, were separated, [and] sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 
ezra:10:17: [And] they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month. 
ezra:10:18: [And] among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, [and] his brethren; Maaseiah, [and] Eliezer, [and] Jarib, [and] Gedaliah.  
ezra:10:19: [And] they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; [and] being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass. 
ezra:10:20: [And] of the sons of Immer; Hanani, [and] Zebadiah.  
ezra:10:21: [And] of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, [and] Elijah, [and] Shemaiah, [and] Jehiel, [and] Uzziah.  
ezra:10:22: [And] of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, [and] Elasah. 
ezra:10:23: Also of the Levites; Jozabad, [and] Shimei, [and] Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, [and] Eliezer. 
ezra:10:24: Of the singers also; Eliashib: [and] of the porters; Shallum, [and] Telem, [and] Uri. 
ezra:10:25: Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, [and] Jeziah, [and] Malchiah, [and] Miamin, [and] Eleazar, [and] Malchijah, [and] Benaiah. 
ezra:10:26: [And] of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, [and] Jehiel, [and] Abdi, [and] Jeremoth, [and] Eliah. 
ezra:10:27: [And] of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, [and] Jeremoth, [and] Zabad, [and] Aziza. 
ezra:10:28: Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, [and] Athlai. 
ezra:10:29: [And] of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, [and] Adaiah, Jashub, [and] Sheal, [and] Ramoth. 
ezra:10:30: [And] of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, [and] Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, [and] Binnui, [and] Manasseh. 
ezra:10:31: [And] of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
ezra:10:32: Benjamin, Malluch, [and] Shemariah. 
ezra:10:33: Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, [and] Shimei. 
ezra:10:34: Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, [and] Uel, 
ezra:10:37: Mattaniah, Mattenai, [and] Jaasau, 
ezra:10:38: [And] Bani, [and] Binnui, Shimei, 
ezra:10:39: [And] Shelemiah, [and] Nathan, [and] Adaiah, 
ezra:10:41: Azareel, [and] Shelemiah, Shemariah,  
ezra:10:42: Shallum, Amariah, [and] Joseph. 
ezra:10:43: Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, [and] Joel, Benaiah.  
ezra:10:44: All these had taken strange wives: [and] some of them had wives by whom they had children.  
ruth:1:1: Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.  [And] a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, [and] his wife, [and] his two sons. 
ruth:1:2: [And] the name of the man was Elimelech, [and] the name of his wife Naomi, [and] the name of his two sons Mahlon [and] Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.  [And] they came into the country of Moab, [and] continued there. 
ruth:1:3: [And] Elimelech Naomi's husband died; [and] she was left, [and] her two sons. 
ruth:1:4: [And] they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, [and] the name of the other  [and] they dwelled there about ten years. 
ruth:1:5: [And] Mahlon [and] Chilion died also both of them; [and] the woman was left of her two sons [and] her husband. 
ruth:1:7: Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, [and] her two daughters in law with her; [and] they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
ruth:1:8: [And] Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, [and] with me. 
ruth:1:9: The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.  Then she kissed them; [and] they lifted up their voice, [and] wept. 
ruth:1:10: [And] they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  
ruth:1:11: [And] Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?  are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
ruth:1:12: Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, [and] should also bear sons; 
ruth:1:14: [And] they lifted up their voice, [and] wept again: [and] Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. 
ruth:1:15: [And] she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, [and] unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. 
ruth:1:16: [And] Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; [and] where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, [and] thy [God] my God:  
ruth:1:17: Where thou diest, will I die, [and] there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, [and] more also, if ought but death part thee [and] me. 
ruth:1:19: So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  [And] it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, [and] they said, Is this Naomi?  
ruth:1:20: [And] she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. 
ruth:1:21: I went out full, [and] the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, [and] the Almighty hath afflicted me? 
ruth:1:22: So Naomi returned, [and] Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: [and] they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. 
ruth:2:1: [And] Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; [and] his name was Boaz. 
ruth:2:2: [And] Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, [and] glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.  [And] she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
ruth:2:3: [And] she went, [and] came, [and] gleaned in the field after the reapers: [and] her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. 
ruth:2:4: [And] behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, [and] said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you.  [And] they answered him, The LORD bless thee. 
ruth:2:6: [And] the servant that was set over the reapers answered [and] said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
ruth:2:7: [And] she said, I pray you, let me glean [and] gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, [and] hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. 
ruth:2:9: Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, [and] go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?  [and] when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, [and] drink of that which the young men have drawn. 
ruth:2:10: Then she fell on her face, [and] bowed herself to the ground, [and] said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? 
ruth:2:11: [And] Boaz answered [and] said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: [and] how thou hast left thy father [and] thy mother, [and] the land of thy nativity, [and] art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. 
ruth:2:12: The LORD recompense thy work, [and] a full reward be given thee of the LORD [God] of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. 
ruth:2:13: Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, [and] for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. 
ruth:2:14: [And] Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, [and] eat of the bread, [and] dip thy morsel in the vinegar.  [And] she sat beside the reapers: [and] he reached her parched corn, [and] she did eat, [and] was sufficed, [and] left. 
ruth:2:15: [And] when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, [and] reproach her not: 
ruth:2:16: [And] let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, [and] leave them, that she may glean them, [and] rebuke her not.  
ruth:2:17: So she gleaned in the field until even, [and] beat out that she had gleaned: [and] it was about an ephah of barley. 
ruth:2:18: [And] she took it up, [and] went into the city: [and] her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: [and] she brought forth, [and] gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.  
ruth:2:19: [And] her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?  [and] where wroughtest thou?  blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.  [And] she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, [and] said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.  
ruth:2:20: [And] Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living [and] to the dead.  [And] Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. 
ruth:2:21: [And] Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 
ruth:2:22: [And] Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. 
ruth:2:23: So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest [and] of wheat harvest; [and] dwelt with her mother in law. 
ruth:3:2: [And] now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. 
ruth:3:3: Wash thyself therefore, [and] anoint thee, [and] put thy raiment upon thee, [and] get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating [and] drinking. 
ruth:3:4: [And] it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, [and] thou shalt go in, [and] uncover his feet, [and] lay thee down; [and] he will tell thee what thou shalt do. 
ruth:3:5: [And] she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. 
ruth:3:6: [And] she went down unto the floor, [and] did according to all that her mother in law bade her. 
ruth:3:7: [And] when Boaz had eaten [and] drunk, [and] his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: [and] she came softly, [and] uncovered his feet, [and] laid her down. 
ruth:3:8: [And] it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, [and] turned himself: [and,] behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
ruth:3:9: [And] he said, Who art thou?  [And] she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. 
ruth:3:10: [And] he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. 
ruth:3:11: [And] now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. 
ruth:3:12: [And] now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
ruth:3:13: Tarry this night, [and] it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. 
ruth:3:14: [And] she lay at his feet until the morning: [and] she rose up before one could know another.  [And] he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. 
ruth:3:15: Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, [and] hold it.  [And] when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, [and] laid it on her: [and] she went into the city.  
ruth:3:16: [And] when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter?  [And] she told her all that the man had done to her. 
ruth:3:17: [And] she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.  
ruth:4:1: Then went Boaz up to the gate, [and] sat him down there: [and,] behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one!  turn aside, sit down here.  [And] he turned aside, [and] sat down. 
ruth:4:2: [And] he took ten men of the elders of the city, [and] said, Sit ye down here.  [And] they sat down. 
ruth:4:3: [And] he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: 
ruth:4:4: [And] I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, [and] before the elders of my people.  If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; [and] I am after thee.  [And] he said, I will redeem it. 
ruth:4:6: [And] the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it. 
ruth:4:7: Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming [and] concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, [and] gave it to his neighbour: [and] this was a testimony in Israel. 
ruth:4:9: [And] Boaz said unto the elders, [and] unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, [and] all that was Chilion's [and] Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 
ruth:4:10: Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, [and] from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day. 
ruth:4:11: [And] all the people that were in the gate, [and] the elders, said, We are witnesses.  The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel [and] like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: [and] do thou worthily in Ephratah, [and] be famous in Bethlehem: 
ruth:4:12: [And] let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman. 
ruth:4:13: So Boaz took Ruth, [and] she was his wife: [and] when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, [and] she bare a son. 
ruth:4:14: [And] the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. 
ruth:4:15: [And] he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, [and] a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. 
ruth:4:16: [And] Naomi took the child, [and] laid it in her bosom, [and] became nurse unto it. 
ruth:4:17: [And] the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; [and] they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
ruth:4:19: [And] Hezron begat Ram, [and] Ram begat Amminadab,  
ruth:4:20: [And] Amminadab begat Nahshon, [and] Nahshon begat Salmon, 
ruth:4:21: [And] Salmon begat Boaz, [and] Boaz begat Obed,
